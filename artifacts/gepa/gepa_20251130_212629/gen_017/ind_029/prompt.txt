Write the intro that makes Wayne lean forward — not by being loud, but by being precise. Let the first bar build tension with Little Ray’s rhythm: urgent, but contained. Every drum hit should feel like a heartbeat, driving the moment without rushing it. The hi-hats should be tight, the kick and snare precise.

In bars 2–4, let the melody begin with a single, clear motif — just a few notes that sing. Give it space to breathe. Let it hang, then return to finish it. No scale runs, no filler. Make every note serve the story.

The bass should walk with chromatic tension, never repeating the same note twice. Diane’s piano should comp with 7th chords, on beats 2 and 4, pushing the rhythm forward but staying out of the way. She’s angry — let that energy be felt in the sound, not the notes.

Keep it focused, tight, and alive. Let the rhythm section support, not overshadow, the moment. Every bar, every note, every rest should feel intentional. Make Wayne hear something new — something that makes him lean forward.
