**Intro – 4 Bars in Dm (D minor), 160 BPM, 4/4 Time**

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Isolation, tension, anticipation.*  
Kick on beat 1, then 3. Snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on every eighth.  
No cymbal crash, no fill — just the sound of a heartbeat under the silence.  
The room holds its breath. Wayne Shorter leans forward.

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, chromatic descent from E♭ to D.*  
E♭ – D – C – B♭ (on beat 4).  
His fingers don’t stop. Each note is a question.  
He hasn’t played anything like this before.

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*7th chords, comp on 2 and 4.*  
On beat 2: Fm7 (F, A♭, C, E♭)  
On beat 4: Gm7 (G, B♭, D, F)  
She’s not backing you — she’s pushing against you.  
Her left hand is already in the next key.

**Bar 2 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*One short motif, hanging in the air.*  
**Motif:**  
D – E♭ (on beat 1)  
Then silence for the rest of the bar.  
A question. A whisper.  
It’s not a statement — it’s an invitation.

**Bar 3 – Everyone in:**  
*Marcus continues the chromatic line: A♭ – G – F – E♭.*  
*Diane plays a descending 7th chord line:*  
Bm7 (B, D, F, A) – Am7 (A, C, E, G) – Gm7  
She’s moving like a storm, but always just behind.  
*Little Ray opens up, fills the space with syncopation and tension.*

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*You return to the motif, but change the rhythm.*  
E♭ – D (on beat 1),  
Then a half-step up to E, then a rest.  
It’s the same melody, but now it’s *different* —  
Like a shadow of something you once knew.

**Bar 4 – Resolution (or not):**  
*Marcus resolves the line with a tritone: E♭ – D – C – B♭.*  
*Diane plays a final 7th chord: Cm7 (C, E♭, G, B♭).*  
*Little Ray locks in, tight and fast, but not too loud.*  
*You play the motif once more, but now it ends with a grace note on C.*  
Then — silence.

**End of Intro.**

---

You didn’t answer the question.  
You didn’t give him a melody — you gave him a memory.  
And for a moment, the room was full of ghosts.  
Wayne Shorter doesn’t clap.  
He just nods.  
And you know —  
You’ve got the gig.
