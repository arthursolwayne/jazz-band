**Dante Russo — "The Question" (Intro — 4 Bars in Dm at 160 BPM)**  
*For Wayne Shorter. For the Cellar. For the moment.*

---

### **Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s) – Little Ray (Drums)**

**Rhythm:**  
- **Hi-hat:** Open on all eighth notes (but with subtle dynamic shifts — soft on 1 & 3, louder on 2 & 4).  
- **Kick drum:** On 1 and 3 — clean, punchy, but not overwhelming.  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4 — crisp, but with a slight delay on the “4” to create a lift.  
- **Fill:** A short, unexpected roll just before the snare on beat 4 — not too long, just enough to make the room hold its breath.  
- **Space:** A small silence after the snare on beat 4 — *intentional*.

> *Let the room taste the silence. Let the tension settle in.*

### **Bars 2–4 (1.5 – 6.0s) – Full Quartet**

#### **Bar 2 – You (Tenor Saxophone)**  
**Motif:**  
- Starts on **D** (the root of Dm).  
- Moves up a **minor third** to **F** (creating tension and ambiguity).  
- Ends on a **Bb** on the “&” of 2 — the **major 7th** of Dm, which is *not* in the key.  
- The note is held for just a beat, then **cut off** — a question, not an answer.

> *A haunting, unresolved phrase. Not a statement, not a run — just a question in the air.*

#### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
- Plays a **chromatic walkdown** from **C** to **D**, with each note landing on the “&” of the beat.  
- The notes are: **C – Bb – B – C – D**  
- Ends on **D**, the root, but played with a **slight rub** against the beat — as if the bass is *pushing* the music forward.

> *A shadow in the dark. Moving, but never loud.*

#### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
- Plays a **sharp, assertive Dm7** chord on beat 2.  
- The chord is **D – F – A – C**, but with a **b7 (C)** that feels just a little *off* — a **C natural** instead of a **C#**.  
- Uses the **left hand** to play a **chromatic line** on the bottom — **C – Bb – B – C** — to support the tension.  
- The right hand plays a **one-note melody** that echoes the sax — **F** on the “&” of 2 — then **space**.

> *A blade in the night. Cutting through the tension, but not resolving it.*

#### **Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
- After the fill, he plays a **tight, syncopated pattern**:  
  - **Kick** on 1 & 3  
  - **Snare** on 2 & 4  
  - **Hi-hat** on every eighth note (but with a **slight delay** on the “&” of 3 and 4)  
- Ends the bar with a **short, syncopated fill** on the “&” of 4 — just a couple of open hi-hats and a snap on the snare.

> *Rhythmic tension, not speed. You feel the push, but not the pace.*

---

#### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Saxophone)**  
- You **repeat the motif**, but now with a **half-step lower** — **C** instead of **D** — to create a sense of **displacement**.  
- The phrase is slightly **dislocated**, like a memory that slipped through the cracks.  
- Ends on **A**, the **minor 7th** of Dm — a **familiar but unresolved** note.

> *A memory walking through the door. Not quite here.*

#### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass)**  
- Chromatic line again, but this time **up** — **D – Eb – E – F** — ending on **F**, the **3rd** of Dm.  
- Played with **rubato** feel, as if he’s not sure where he is.

> *He’s moving, but he’s lost in the moment.*

#### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano)**  
- Comp with a **sharp Dm7** on beat 2, again with the **b7**.  
- Left hand plays a **descending chromatic** line: **F – Eb – D – C**  
- Right hand echoes the sax again — **A** on the “&” of 2.

> *She’s not trying to resolve it. She’s trying to feel it.*

#### **Bar 3 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Same pattern, same tension — but with a **slight shift in dynamics**, like he’s **listening** now.  
- The hi-hats are **slightly louder** on the “&” of 3 and 4.

> *Now he’s not just playing. He’s listening.*

---

#### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Saxophone)**  
- You **resolve the motif**, but only **partially** —  
  - **D** (root) on beat 1  
  - **F** (minor 3rd) on the “&” of 1  
  - **Bb** (major 7th) on beat 2  
  - **Hold it** — then **cut it off**.  
- Just a **pause**. No resolution. Just a **question**.

> *The moment hangs. The room holds its breath.*

#### **Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass)**  
- Plays a **chromatic run** from **F to G**, ending on **G**, the **5th** of Dm.  
- Played with a **slight rub against the beat** — as if he’s still not sure.

> *He’s anchoring it, but not answering it.*

#### **Bar 4 – Diane (Piano)**  
- Plays a **final, assertive Dm7**, again with the **b7**, but now **on beat 4**.  
- Left hand plays a **quick chromatic run** up to **G**, the 5th.  
- Right hand plays a **single, lingering note** — **Bb**, the **major 7th** — and **holds it**.

> *She’s not giving it up. She’s holding on.*

#### **Bar 4 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
- A **final fill** — quick, syncopated, **not too loud**, but **present**.  
- Ends on a **soft snare on beat 4**, followed by **a beat of silence**.

> *The drum doesn’t break the silence. It lives in it.*

---

### **End of Intro:**
- Silence.  
- A question.  
- A moment.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.

> *You've made your point. You've left the room hanging on the edge of something new. You've made it matter.*
