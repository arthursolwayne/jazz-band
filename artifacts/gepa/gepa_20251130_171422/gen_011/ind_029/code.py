**INTRO – “Door in the Dark” (4 bars in Dm, 160 BPM)**

---

**BAR 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Set the scene with space and tension.*

- Kick: On beat 1 only (slightly behind the grid, for that push).  
- Snare: On beat 2, soft, like a whisper.  
- Hi-hat: On beat 3, open, slightly ahead of the beat.  
- Snare again: On beat 4, crisp and sharp, like a door creaking open.  
- Cymbal: Open hi-hat on the “&” of 3, subtle, like a breath after the question.

---

**BAR 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, chromatic approach to Dm7, with purpose and emotion.*

- Dm7 chord outline: D – F – A – C  
- Walking line:  
  **Beat 1:** C (chromatic approach to D)  
  **Beat 2:** D  
  **Beat 3:** E♭ (chromatic approach to D)  
  **Beat 4:** F (chromatic approach to E)  
- This creates a tension that resolves just out of reach.

---

**BAR 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp on 2 and 4 with 7th chords, emotional and sparse.*

- **Beat 2:** Dm7 (D – F – A – C) – played with a touch of dissonance on the F  
- **Beat 4:** Gm7 (G – B♭ – D – F) – a pivot, a hint of movement  
- Leave space between the chords — let the silence speak

---

**BAR 3 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Build the urgency, slightly louder, more insistent.*

- Kick: On 1 and 3 (same as before but with more weight)  
- Snare: On 2 and 4, a bit harder  
- Hi-hat: On every eighth, but with subtle dynamic variation  
- Cymbal: Crash cymbal on the “&” of 2, just a whisper, like a shadow

---

**BAR 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Continues the walking line, with a slight rub against Diane’s chords.*

- **Beat 1:** G (chromatic approach to A)  
- **Beat 2:** A  
- **Beat 3:** B♭ (chromatic approach to A)  
- **Beat 4:** B (chromatic approach to C) – creates a subtle tension that lingers

---

**BAR 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Add some color, a dissonant note on the “&” of 3 — B♭ over Gm7 — to create a sense of unresolved tension.*

---

**BAR 4 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Final push, more energy, like the door is about to open.*

- Kick: On 1 and 3  
- Snare: On 2 and 4, harder  
- Hi-hat: On every eighth, but with a slight speed-up on the last two eighths  
- Cymbal: Snare ride on the “&” of 4, like a gasp

---

**BAR 4 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Final note a half-step above the root of Dm — E♭ — a half-step resolution that feels like a question, not an answer.*

- **Beat 1:** E♭  
- **Beat 2:** D  
- **Beat 3:** E♭  
- **Beat 4:** D (dampened, like a held breath)

---

**BAR 4 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Final chord: Dm7 with a B♭ in the right hand — a hint of the blues, a twist in the story.*

- Left hand: Dm7  
- Right hand: B♭ on beat 4, held into the next measure

---

**BAR 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*One short, haunting motif that lingers in the air like a question.*

- **Beat 1:** C (Bb clarinet tone, slightly bent)  
- **Beat 2:** D (high and clear, like a voice calling out)  
- **Beat 3:** E♭ (chromatic, like a whisper)  
- **Beat 4:** Rest — silence. The door is open. The moment is there.

---

**Ending:**  
- The room holds its breath.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- The music is not finished, but it has already said everything.
