Bar 1 – *A question in the dark.*

Bar 3 – *A push, a pull, a moment of tension.*  
Bar 4 – *Close, but not resolved — a breath held, waiting for the next beat.*

Let the silence between the phrases breathe. Let the player feel the weight of what’s left unsaid. The music doesn’t answer — it invites the listener into the mystery.
