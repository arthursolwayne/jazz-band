Create a piece that builds tension and releases it with clarity. Start with a driving, syncopated drum groove that feels alive and full of motion. Use the hihat for rhythmic texture and subtle syncopation to create momentum. In the second bar, introduce a melodic saxophone line that is concise, spaced, and expressive — leave room for the rhythm and harmony to breathe. The bass should walk with chromatic motion and avoid repetition, keeping the harmony moving. The piano should support with rich, open 7th chords, playing only on the strong beats to let the melody and rhythm shine. Every instrument must have its own voice, but together they must form a unified, flowing statement.
