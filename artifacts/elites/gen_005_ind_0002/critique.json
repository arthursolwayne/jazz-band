  "rationale": "This arrangement uses basic triads in all parts (C, D, G) without 7th extensions or jazz harmony vocabulary. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat playing on downbeats and upbeats but lacks the driving Latin feel. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop phrasing or chromaticism. The trumpet is silent throughout, and there's no call-and-response between instruments. The overall feel is academic and lacks the swing, soul, and improvisational spirit of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) for authentic jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes and enclosures to saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in hihat pattern with more syncopation on upbeats",
    "Use walking bass (roots, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) instead of just root notes",
    "Add ii-V-I progressions in bars 3-4 for authentic jazz harmonic movement"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
