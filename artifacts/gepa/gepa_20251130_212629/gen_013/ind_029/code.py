**Bar 1: Little Ray (Rhythm Section – Piano, Bass, Drums)**

*Start with a tight, driving groove built on a syncopated, off-kilter rhythm that feels urgent but controlled. Think of it as the heartbeat of the piece—subtle tension, not chaos.*

- **Piano (Left Hand):**  
  **Dm7** in a walking bass line, syncopated on the “&” of 2 and 4.  
  *Example:*  
  D – F – A – C | D – F – A – C | D – F – A – C | D – F – A – C  

- **Bass (Walking Line):**  
  Syncopated on the “&” of 2 and 4, using Dm7 chord tones:  
  D – F – A – C | D – F – A – C | D – F – A – C | D – F – A – C  

- **Drums:**  
  Snare on 2 & 4, light hihat on the “&” of 1 and 3, kick on 1.  
  *Feel like a slow-burn tension building, not too heavy, but present.*

**Bar 2: Tenor Saxophone – Melody Motif (First Statement)**

*Enter the sax with a short, memorable motif that feels like a question, or the first line of a story. Use space between notes to let the phrase breathe and linger.*

- **Motif (Measures 2–3):**  
  **D – F – G – A** (with a slight rubato on the **G**)  
  *Play with dynamic phrasing: soft on the D and F, a little louder on G and A, then a breath before the next phrase.*

---

**Bar 3: Tenor Saxophone – Development of Motif**

*Repeat the motif but with variation—maybe a half-step up or a subtle rhythmic shift to keep it fresh. Keep the phrasing tight, intentional, and powerful.*

- **Motif (Measures 3–4):**  
  **E – G – A – B** (a half-step higher, same rhythm)  
  *Same dynamic idea: soft on the first note, building to a full, resonant high B.*

---

**Bar 4: Return to Rhythm, Build to Release**

*Let the rhythm section swell slightly, but stay supportive. The saxophone ends the bar with a sustained A, resolving the tension just enough to set up the next phrase.*

- **Piano:**  
  Comp with D7 harmony, subtle, echoing the motif.  
- **Bass:**  
  Walks into Bm7, leading into the next key or phrase.  
- **Drums:**  
  Kick on 1, light cymbal roll on 3, snare on 4—subtle but present.

---

**Final Note (Bar 4 End):**  
Saxophone holds the **A** on the last beat, sustained and rich, leaving a moment of silence before the next section begins. *This is the hook. This is the moment Wayne leans forward.*

---

**Summary of Tension & Flow:**

- **Bar 1:** Urgent, tight, contained rhythm.
- **Bar 2–3:** Melody with space and intention, short motif with emotional weight.
- **Bar 4:** Build toward release, rhythm section supports, saxophone closes with a resonant, unresolved note.

*Every note serves the story. No rests, no excess. Just movement, intention, and a feeling of something about to happen.*
