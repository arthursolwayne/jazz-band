### **Bar 2 (1.5 – 3.0s)**  
**Drums:**  
- Sustain the same groove but add a subtle roll on the snare at the end of the bar  
- Hihat pattern shifts slightly: two eighth notes, then a rest on &3

  **D – Eb – C – Bb – D – Eb – C – B – D**  
  (Still rooted in Dm, but with more tension)  

**Piano:**  
- Introduce a short, melodic motif over the Dm7 chord:  
  **D – F – Bb – C**  
  (One note per beat, played softly, on the downbeats)  
- Left hand continues walking rhythmically with the bass  

**Sax:**  
- First melodic entrance:  
  **D – F – Bb – C** (same as piano)  
  - Play with space: pause between each note

  **D – Eb – C – B – D – Eb – C – Bb**

  **&2: D, &3: F, &4: Bb, beat 1: C**  
- Left hand: Root-fifth intervals, walking with the bass

- Play the final note (D) slightly longer, echoing the sax  

**Piano:**  
- Last note of the motif (C) on beat 4  
- Resolve the harmony with a Dm7 chord  
- Play a single C on the last beat, lingering  

**Sax:**

- Silence after the note — the last breath

### **Overall Notes for Performance:**

- **Balance**: Every instrument plays with purpose — no overcrowding, no silence without reason.  
- **Space**: The saxophone and piano are subtle, letting the rhythm section drive the feel.  
- **Dynamics**: Use subtle swells and decays to create momentum.  
- **Phrasing**: Let the music breathe — even in fast tempo, there’s room for the notes to live.  

This is a moment — a breath — a pulse — and a beginning.
