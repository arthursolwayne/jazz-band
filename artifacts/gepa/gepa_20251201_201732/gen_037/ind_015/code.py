### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On beats 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Space:** 2 brief rests — first on the "&" of 1, second on the "&" of 3  
**Effect:** A subtle, syncopated rhythm that builds tension without noise. The silence is as important as the beat.

### **Bar 3: Diane (Piano) – Open voicings, comp on 2 and 4**  
**Bar 3 Chord: Gm7 (G-Bb-D-F)**

**Bar 4 Chord: Dm7 (D-F-A-C)**  
**Voicing:** Same as Bar 2, but played with more force and clarity, as if the memory is now clear  
**Rhythm:** On beat 2 and 4, with a final chord that hangs, unresolved but complete

### **Final Moment:**  
The room holds. The memory walks through. You don’t need to say it — it’s in the space. Wayne Shorter nods. The crowd leans in.

That’s the intro.
