### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**

**Rhythm:**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3  
- Snare on beat 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note  
- **But leave the last eighth before beat 4 empty** — a breath, a pause, a question mark.

**Feel:**  
- The kick hits like a heartbeat, steady and heavy.  
- The snare is sharp, clean, almost like a whisper on the offbeats.  
- The hihat is consistent, but the last eighth before the end is **missing** — space.  
- This is the beginning of the story, not the story itself.

### **Bars 2–4 – Full Band**

---

#### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- **D (root)**  
- **Eb (chromatic descent)**  
- **F (chromatic ascent)**  
- **G (tension)**  
- **Then repeat the same pattern but end on F#**  
- **Not resolving — just walking, restless, searching**

**Feel:**  
- The bass is a shadow moving in the dark — always shifting, never settling.  
- It’s the foundation, but it’s not giving the melody away.

---

#### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Comping:**  
- **Beat 2:** Bb7 (Bb D F Ab)  
- **Beat 4:** C7 (C E G B)  
- **Play each chord with a touch of dissonance — a little tension before release**

**Feel:**  
- Diane is angry, but she’s not screaming. She’s building a fire.  
- She knows the answer, but she’s not giving it away yet.  
- Her chords don’t resolve — they only hint at resolution.

---

#### **Bar 2 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif (start):**  
- **D (baritone register, soft, breathy)**  
- **Eb (chromatic descent)**  
- **F (hold it, let it linger)**  
- **Then a rest — a silence — for the last eighth of the bar**

**Feel:**  
- This is your question.  
- You’re not telling the story — you’re setting the scene.  
- The silence is louder than the note.  
- You’re not answering — you’re inviting.

---

#### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- **F# (chromatic descent)**  
- **G (chromatic ascent)**  
- **A (tension)**  
- **Then repeat the same pattern but end on Bb**  
- **Still unresolved — still searching**

**Feel:**  
- The bass is the ground, but it’s not solid.  
- It’s shifting, like the floor beneath your feet.

---

#### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Comping:**  
- **Beat 2:** C7 (C E G B)  
- **Beat 4:** D7 (D F# A C)  
- **Again, a little dissonance, a little tension**

**Feel:**  
- She’s building the pressure, the heat.  
- She’s not afraid to let the dissonance live.

---

#### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif (continue):**  
- **C (start again, but lower this time, like a memory)**  
- **D (chromatic descent)**  
- **Eb (hold it, let it hang)**  
- **Then another rest — another silence**

**Feel:**  
- It’s the same motif — but lower, like a memory or a shadow of the first.  
- You’re not repeating — you’re echoing.  
- You’re not answering — you’re asking again.

---

#### **Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- **Bb (chromatic descent)**  
- **B (chromatic ascent)**  
- **C (tension)**  
- **Then repeat, ending on D**  
- **Still unresolved — still searching**

**Feel:**  
- The bass is the anchor, but it’s not sure where it’s anchoring.

---

#### **Bar 4 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Comping:**  
- **Beat 2:** D7 (D F# A C)  
- **Beat 4:** Eb7 (Eb G Bb D)  
- **Again, tension, again, dissonance**

**Feel:**  
- She’s pushing the edge — not letting it break, not letting it go.

---

#### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif (finish):**  
- **B (start again, this time with more emotion, more weight)**  
- **C (chromatic descent)**  
- **D (hold it, let it hang, let it live)**  
- **Then a final rest — a silence — for the last eighth of the bar**

**Feel:**  
- This is your moment.  
- You didn’t say it all.  
- You left it hanging.  
- You let the silence speak.

---

### **Final Moment:**

- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- The room holds its breath.  
- A door has opened.  
- The music is not a song — it’s a question.  
- And it’s waiting for an answer.

---

**That’s the intro.**  
Now, the rest of the night is yours.
