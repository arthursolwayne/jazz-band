**Dm Intro – 4 Bars, 160 BPM, 4/4 Time**

**Bar 1 (0.00–1.50s): Little Ray – Drums Alone**

- **Kick**: On beats 1 and 3 (staccato, sharp, like a heartbeat)
- **Snare**: On beats 2 and 4 (dry, with a slight snap, not too loud)
- **Hi-Hat**: On every eighth note (light, brushed, almost whispering)
- **Fill**: At the end of the bar — a single open hi-hat on the "and" of 4, like a breath held, then silence.

*The room holds. The weight of the next bar is a question.*

**Bar 2 (1.50–3.00s): Bass and Piano Enter**

- **Marcus (Bass)**:  
  Starts on **Dm7** – arpeggiated: **D – F – A – C** (root, b3, 5, b7)  
  But the line is **chromatic** from D:  
  **D – Eb – D – F – E – F – A – G**  
  *A walking line that dips and climbs, never settling, searching.*

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  Comps with **Dm7** on beat 2 and 4 (D – F – A – C)  
  But her left hand plays a **diminished passing chord** on beat 1: **F#dim7** (F# – A – C – D)  
  *A dissonance that lingers like a memory.*

*The tension is there, but it's not yet resolved.*

---

**Bar 3 (3.00–4.50s): Tenor Enters – Your Motif**

- **You (Tenor Sax):**  
  Play a **short, descending motif** that begins with a **quarter note** on beat 1:

  **D – C – Bb – A**  
  *Smooth, legato, like a sigh. Then — silence. A rest on beat 2.*

  *Let the silence speak. Let it hang. Let it *mean* something.*

- **Marcus**:  
  Keeps the walking line — now **Bb – A – G – F**  
  *Still chromatic, still searching, but now it’s answering something.*

- **Diane**:  
  Comp on beat 4 with **Dm7**, but the **top note is A**, not C — a **suspended chord** (Dm7sus4)  
  *A subtle shift, like a new way of thinking.*

- **Little Ray**:  
  Hi-hat continues, but now with a **half-time feel** on the "and" of 2 and 4  
  *Rhythm is shifting — it’s not just time anymore.*

---

**Bar 4 (4.50–6.00s): Resolution in Motion**

- **You (Tenor Sax):**  
  Return with the **same motif**, but **inverted** — ascending this time:  
  **A – Bb – C – D**  
  *It’s the same notes, but it’s *not* the same. It’s a mirror, a reflection, a recognition.*

  End with a **short, open note** on D — a **half note** that lingers into the next bar, unresolved.

- **Marcus**:  
  Ends the bar with a **chromatic run** up to a **C**, then a **rest**  
  *He leaves it open. He never says “yes.”*

- **Diane**:  
  Ends with a **D7** on beat 4 (D – F – A – C#)  
  *A dominant chord, but not the resolution. It’s a doorway.*

- **Little Ray**:  
  Ends the bar with a **ghost note** on the "and" of 4, then silence.  
  *The beat is still there, but it’s not loud anymore.*

**Final Silence (6.00s):**

- The room is still. The air is charged.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- You didn’t play a scale. You didn’t play a riff.  
- You played **something that matters.**

**That’s the intro.**
