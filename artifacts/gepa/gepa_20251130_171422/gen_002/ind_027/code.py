*Tempo: 160 BPM*  
*Time Signature: 4/4*  
*Length: 4 bars (6 seconds)*  

---

**BAR 1: Little Ray – Drums (Fragile tension)**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3  
- Snare on beat 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth  
- Fill: a ghost note on the & of 3, then a soft rimshot on the & of 4  
- The beat is precise, but feels like it’s barely holding on — like the edge of a cliff  

---

**BAR 2: Marcus (Bass) – Walking, chromatic, precise**  
- Dm7 chord tone: D, F, Ab, C  
- Chromatic approach to D: C# on beat 1  
- Then a walking line:  
  - Beat 1: C#  
  - Beat 2: D  
  - Beat 3: F  
  - Beat 4: Ab  
- Then a descending chromatic run: Ab – G – F – Eb – D  
- All over the fretboard, but always landing on the right note, always moving forward  

---

**BAR 2: Diane (Piano) – 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4**  
- Comp on beat 2: Dm7 (D, F, Ab, C)  
- Comp on beat 4: F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
- Rest of the bar: space. She’s listening, she’s ready.  
- Her left hand is low, steady, and just *there* — grounding the whole thing  

---

**BAR 3: Dante (Tenor Sax) – The motif**  
- Start on D (Dm), play a short, lyrical phrase:  
  - D – Eb – F – Eb – D  
  - Then a rest on beat 3  
  - Then a half-step down: C#  
- It’s simple, but it’s *real*. It feels like a memory, like a question.  
- You don’t finish it. You leave it hanging.  
- The rest is the punctuation. The silence is the note.

---

**BAR 4: Full ensemble — you finish the motif**  
- You come back in with the same motif, but this time you finish it:  
  - D – Eb – F – Eb – D – C# – D  
- Marcus walks the same chromatic line again, but now with more urgency  
- Diane plays a Dm7 chord on beat 1, a C7 on beat 3  
- Little Ray fills the bar with a big, percussive fill on the & of 3 and 4  
- The whole room holds its breath for a second — and then it’s gone

**And that’s it.**  
Four bars. One story.  
You left it open.  
You made him lean forward.

Wayne Shorter’s glass is empty.  
He’s still sitting there.  
Listening.
