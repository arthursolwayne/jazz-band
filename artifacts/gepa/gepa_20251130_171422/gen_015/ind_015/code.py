**Intro: "Shadow of the Monk"**  
*Key: Dm | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4 | Length: 6 seconds*

---

**BAR 1 – LITTLE RAY (DRUMS):**  
*Drum set, no cymbals. Just the kick and snare. A rhythm that feels like a breath held.*

- **Kick:** On beat 1 and 3 (but not quite on the beat — slightly behind, like a whisper).
- **Snare:** On beat 2 and 4 (but not quite on the beat — slightly ahead, like a question).
- The result is a tension between what you expect and what you hear — a ghost of a groove, not quite there, but *trembling* on the edge of it.

**BAR 2 – FULL ENSEMBLE IN (BARS 2–4):**

**Diane (Piano):**
- **Bar 2:** Bbm7 (Dm7 with b9) on beat 2, resolving to Gm7 on beat 4.  
  *Chords are modal, but with a hard edge — a hint of dissonance, like the sky before a storm.*
- **Bar 3:** Cm7 on beat 2, Dm7 on beat 4.  
  *She’s building a bridge here, not just comping — she’s guiding the mood.*
- **Bar 4:** F7 on beat 2, Gm7 on beat 4.  
  *One step forward, one step back — a tension that wants to resolve but doesn’t.*

**Marcus (Bass):**
- **Bar 2:** Dm7 chord tones, but walks up the scale: D, Eb, F, G (chromatic approach to G).
- **Bar 3:** Cm7 — walks with a half-step chromatic line from C to Bb.
- **Bar 4:** F7 — walks from F to G to Ab to Bb, with a sharp turn down to D.
- *He’s moving the air, not just the notes.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**
- **Bar 2:** Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Hi-hat on every eighth, but slightly behind the beat, like he’s running through a hallway of echoes.
- **Bar 3:** Same pattern, but now with a ghost note on the & of 2 and 4 — a whisper of the future.
- **Bar 4:** Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Hi-hat on every eighth, but now with a slight delay on the & of 3 — like a footstep on a creaking floorboard.

**You (Tenor Sax):**
- **Bar 2:** Start on D, then a triplet: D – Eb – F (a half-step chromatic line).  
  *A question, not an answer. Suspense. A whisper in the dark.*
- **Bar 3:** A counter-melody: G – A – Bb – B – C (sliding up chromatically into a blue note, then resolving with a half-step bend on C).
- **Bar 4:** Return to the D motif — D – Eb – F — but now with a slight delay, like you're hearing yourself from a distance.  
  *You don’t finish it — you leave it hanging, like a note in a dream.*

**Final Impression:**
- The first bar is a question — a drum rhythm that feels like a heartbeat but isn’t.
- The next three bars are the answer — not a resolution, but a reorientation of what the music *can be*.
- Wayne Shorter leans forward. He hears the ghost of Coltrane in the space between the notes, but also something new — a voice that's not been heard yet.

It’s not a melody. It’s a *moment*.  
And that’s enough.
