  "rationale": "The arrangement lacks essential jazz harmony elements, relying on triads (C-E-G, D-F-A, etc.) rather than 7th chords or extensions. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat hitting only the 'and' of each beat inconsistently. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The trumpet is completely silent throughout, and there's no call-and-response between instruments. The overall feel is academic and lacks the spontaneity and sophistication of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes to saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in hihat pattern instead of straight quarters",
    "Use walking bass (roots, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) instead of just root notes",
    "Add ii-V-I progressions in bars 3-4 for authentic jazz harmony"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
