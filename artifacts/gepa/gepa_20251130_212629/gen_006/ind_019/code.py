**Key: D Minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 4 bars = 6 seconds**  
**Mood: Restless, curious, unresolved.**

### **Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s): Little Ray – Drums**  
- **Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On beats 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (closed, crisp)  
- **Fill:** On beat 4, a quick triplet on the snare, then a sharp cymbal crash just before the end of the bar.  
- **Purpose:** Build tension. Make the room hold its breath.

### **Bar 2 (1.5 - 3.0s): Diane – Piano (Comping)**  
- **Chords:** Dm7 (D F A C)  
- **Comping:** Dm7 on beat 2, then Gm7 (G B♭ D F) on beat 4  
- **Voicings:** Rootless, with extensions (e.g., Dm7 = F A C E♭)  
- **Purpose:** Set the harmonic foundation, but keep it sparse. Let the chord changes feel like questions.

### **Bar 3 (3.0 - 4.5s): Marcus – Bass (Walking Line)**  
- **Line:**  
  - D → C → B♭ → A (chromatic descent from D)  
  - Then A → G → F → E (chromatic descent again)  
- **Purpose:** The bass line is a thread, pulling the listener deeper. It’s not just walking—it’s searching.

### **Bar 4 (4.5 - 6.0s): You – Tenor Sax (Melody)**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **Bar 4, beat 1:** Play a **D** on the beat, then a **B♭** on the "and" of 1  
  - **Bar 4, beat 2:** **A** on the beat, **G** on the "and"  
  - **Bar 4, beat 3:** **F** on the beat, **E** on the "and"  
  - **Bar 4, beat 4:** End on a **D**, but **hold** it—don’t resolve. Let the note linger, like a question.  
- **Phrasing:** Play it slow, with a breath between each note. Let the silence after the final D speak.

### **Final Moment (6.0s):**  
- The room holds its breath.  
- Wayne Shorter sets down his whiskey.  
- The silence is louder than the sound.  
- You’ve told a story in four bars.  
- The rest of the set? That’s just the answer.
