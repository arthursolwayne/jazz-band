**Dante Russo — "Question in D" (4 Bar Intro)**  
*D key, 160 BPM, 4/4 time, 6 seconds total*

---

**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth  
- **Feel:** A breath before the storm. The room holds. The silence is heavy. The question lingers.

**Bar 2: Diane (Piano) — Comping**  
- **Bar 2:** Dmaj7 (D-F#-A-C#) — open voicing, upper structure  
- **Bar 2, beat 2:** Bm7 (B-D-F#-A)  
- **Bar 2, beat 4:** G7 (G-B-D-F) — with a #9 (A)  
- **Comp on 2 and 4:** Diane plays the Bm7 on 2, resolves to G7 on 4. The tension is there — a challenge, a warning, a hook.

**Bar 3: Marcus (Bass) — Walking Line**  
- **D2 to G2 (38-43 MIDI)**  
- **Line:**  
  - D2 (1)  
  - E2 (2)  
  - F#2 (3)  
  - G2 (4)  
  - A2 (1)  
  - Bb2 (2)  
  - B2 (3)  
  - C#2 (4)  
- Chromatic approach to B2, then resolution to C#2 — it’s not quite where you expect. The anchor is steady, but the descent hints at something unresolved.

**Bar 4: Dante (Tenor Sax) — Melody**  
- **Motif:**  
  - D (1)  
  - E (2)  
  - F# (3)  
  - G (4)  
  - **Then, on beat 2:** Bb (2)  
  - **Beat 3:** B (3)  
  - **Beat 4:** C# (4)  
- **Play it with space.** Start the motif clean, then let the last two notes hang — Bb and B — like a memory that’s not quite memory. Leave it open. Let the silence speak. Let Wayne hear something new.

---

**Final Moment:**  
- Diane resolves the G7 on beat 4 with a C# in the upper register.  
- Marcus walks into the C#2.  
- Little Ray snare on 4, hihat on 8.  
- The room is still. You’ve made him lean forward.

**Mystery remains.** It’s not over. It’s just beginning.
