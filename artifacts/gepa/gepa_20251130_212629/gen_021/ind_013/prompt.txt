Create an intro that feels like a whisper before a storm — build tension with space and restraint, then release it with clarity and purpose. The drums should establish a heartbeat, subtle but insistent, with every hit counting. The ensemble enters with intention, not force — the saxophone melody is simple but emotionally charged, lingering in the air like a question. Every note is intentional, every rest meaningful. Avoid unnecessary repetition. Keep the rhythm tight, the harmony honest, and the space between the notes alive. The bass should walk with chromatic tension, the piano should comp with 7th chords on 2 and 4, and the drums should fill the bar with hihat on every eighth. The saxophone motif should start, leave it hanging, and return to finish it — no scale runs, just a story in four bars. Make Wayne lean forward.
