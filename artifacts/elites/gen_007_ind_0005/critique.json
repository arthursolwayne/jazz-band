  "rationale": "The arrangement uses basic triads in the piano and bass (C-E-G, D-F-A, etc.) without 7th chords or jazz extensions, resulting in a very non-jazzy sound. The rhythm section has a basic backbeat with some hihat activity, but lacks the syncopation and upbeats typical of Latin jazz. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary, chromaticism, or blues inflection. The trumpet is completely silent throughout, and there is minimal interaction between instruments, making the interplay weak. Overall, the piece sounds more like a music theory exercise than authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes and blues inflections to the saxophone line for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in the hihat pattern and add ghost notes on the snare for authentic Latin jazz feel",
    "Use walking bass lines with roots, 3rds, 5ths, and 7ths instead of root notes only",
    "Add call-and-response between saxophone and trumpet, and give the trumpet more melodic material"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
