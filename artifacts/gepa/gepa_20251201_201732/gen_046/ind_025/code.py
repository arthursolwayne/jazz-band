**Key:** D minor  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM (4/4 time)  
**Time:** 6.0 seconds total  
**Mood:** Searching, unresolved, seductive tension

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth, soft and sparse  
**Fill:** A single cymbal crash on the "and" of 4, just before the band enters  
**Dynamic:** Mid-low, with a slight build toward the end of the bar

> *The room holds its breath. The silence is not empty—it’s waiting. Ray’s kick is like a heartbeat, slow and deliberate. The cymbal crash is a whisper of what’s to come.*

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- D2 (root)  
- F2 (fifth, with a chromatic approach from E2)  
- G2 (chromatic passing tone)  
- C2 (fifth of Dm, but with a flat 9th trace in the bowing)  
> *Walking line, roots and fifths. The chromatic approach is subtle—like a shadow in the corner of your eye.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Dm7 (D F A C) – open voicing, left hand in root position  
- Bar 2: Fm7 (F A C Eb) – resolving on the last beat with a C in the right hand  
> *Open voicings, no overcomplication. The chords are like questions in the dark.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1, 3  
- Snare on 2, 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth, slightly louder  
> *The rhythm tightens, but still has space. It’s not urgency—it’s invitation.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- Motif:  
  - D (bar 2, beat 1) – starts the melody, a single note, high and sustained  
  - E (bar 2, beat 2) – a half-step up, like a question  
  - F (bar 2, beat 3) – a resolve, but not quite  
  - G (bar 2, beat 4) – ends on a note that doesn’t quite belong  
> *Not a scale run. Just a phrase that suggests something is missing—like a memory you can't name.*

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- A2 (fifth of Dm, with a chromatic approach from Bb2)  
- Bb2 (chromatic passing tone)  
- C2 (root of Fm7, again with a flat 9th trace)  
- D2 (root of Dm, but a bit elongated, like a sigh)  
> *He’s still walking, but the line is now more emotional, more vulnerable.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Fm7 (F A C Eb) – open voicing, left hand in root position  
- Bar 3: Gm7 (G Bb D F) – resolving on the last beat with a D in the right hand  
> *The chords are moving, but not too quickly. They’re like footprints in the sand.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1, 3  
- Snare on 2, 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth, with a slight swell on the third beat  
> *The rhythm is still there, but now it’s like a heartbeat with a pulse of its own.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- Motif:  
  - G (bar 3, beat 1) – repeats the motif from the previous bar, shifted up  
  - A (bar 3, beat 2) – another half-step up, as if he’s chasing something  
  - Bb (bar 3, beat 3) – a chromatic descent  
  - C (bar 3, beat 4) – ends on a note that feels like a return, but not yet a resolution  
> *The melody is searching—like the first line of a story that hasn’t been written yet.*

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- C2 (root of Gm7, chromatic approach from B2)  
- D2 (chromatic passing tone)  
- E2 (fifth of Gm7)  
- F2 (root of Dm, with a slight pull toward the G)  
> *He’s still walking, but now the line feels more like a bridge, a passage to something else.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Gm7 (G Bb D F) – open voicing, left hand in root position  
- Bar 4: Am7 (A C E G) – resolves on the last beat with a G in the right hand  
> *The chords are open, but not empty. They’re waiting for the melody to say more.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1, 3  
- Snare on 2, 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth, with a slight roll on beat 4  
> *The rhythm is full now, but still has the space to breathe. It’s like a story that’s just beginning.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- Motif:  
  - C (bar 4, beat 1) – the motif returns, but now it’s in a new key  
  - D (bar 4, beat 2) – like a memory of the first note  
  - Eb (bar 4, beat 3) – it’s still searching  
  - Ends on an open D, held for a moment, like the last note of a question  
> *The melody is not finished, but it’s not unfinished either. It’s open. It’s waiting for someone to answer.*

**Final Moment:**  
Wayne Shorter leans in.  
The room is holding its breath.  
The music hasn't ended—it’s just beginning.
