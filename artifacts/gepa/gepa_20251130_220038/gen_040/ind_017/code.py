**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Whispered, sparse, teasing the air.*  
Kick on beat 1, snare on beat 3.  
Hi-hat on the "and" of 1 and 3.  
A soft *click* on the "and" of 4, like a breath held.  
Silence on beat 2.  
*Let it wait. Let it ache.*

**Bar 2: Marcus (Bass) enters**  
*Walking line in F minor, chromatic approach to F7.*  
**Beat 1:** F  
**Beat 2:** G♭  
**Beat 3:** G  
**Beat 4:** A♭  
*Subtle vibrato, like a sigh.*

**Diane (Piano) enters on beat 2**  
*7th chords, comping on 2 and 4.*  
**Beat 2:** F7 (F A C E)  
**Beat 4:** G7 (G B D F)  
*Soft, but urgent. She’s not asking — she’s demanding.*

---

**Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax) enter on beat 3**  
*Short, vocalized motif — like a cry in the dark.*  
**Beat 3:** F (a low, growling F, like a whisper)  
**Beat 4:** A♭ (a rising, anguished A♭)  
*Rest on beat 1 of bar 4. Silence. Let it hang.*

---

**Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) continue**  
*Return on beat 2 with a resolution — but not the one you expect.*  
**Beat 2:** C (a sudden, bright C)  
**Beat 3:** B♭ (a question mark)  
**Beat 4:** F (a return, but not the same F)  
*It’s not a resolution — it’s a reentry.*  
*The air holds. The room breathes. Wayne leans forward.*

---

**End of 4 bars.**  
*The last note lingers — not a closing, but a beginning.*  
*You’ve asked the question. Now it’s his turn to answer.*
