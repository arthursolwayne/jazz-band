### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** 1 & 3  
**Snare:** 2 & 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every 8th note  
**Feel:** Tight, precise, but with a little edge—like a heartbeat under pressure.  
**Fill:** No fill, just the pulse. Let the silence breathe. Let the anticipation build.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble In**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **F** (root)  
- **Ab** (fifth, chromatic approach from G)  
- **C** (root, chromatic approach from Bb)  
- **Eb** (fifth, chromatic approach from D)  
**Line:** F – Gb – C – Bb – Eb (root and fifth with chromatic approaches)

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 2:** Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb) – open voicing, left hand on C and G, right hand on Eb and Bb  
- **Bar 3:** G7b9 (G, Bb, D, F, Ab) – left hand on G and D, right hand on Bb and Ab  
- **Bar 4:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb) – left hand on F and C, right hand on Ab and Eb  
**Comping:** Diane plays on the “&” of 2 and 4, each bar with a different voicing, leading back to Fm7 in the last bar.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same pattern as Bar 1—consistent drive, but now with more weight.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif:**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - **F** (long, sustained, open)  
  - **Ab** (short, staccato, like a breath)  
  - **Bb** (half note, soft, questioning)  
- **Bar 3:**  
  - **C** (half note, higher, more assertive)  
- **Bar 4:**  
  - **F** (half note, return to the root, but with a slight vibrato)  
- **Phrasing:** Leave the F hanging at the end of Bar 2, then return to it in Bar 4. The motif is not a scale—just a question and its answer. It’s a small, emotional arc.

### **Final Feel:**  
It's not a melody—it’s a whisper. It's not a statement, it’s an invitation. The tension is in the space between the notes. The harmony is clear, but the voice is uncertain. It’s the sound of a young man with the weight of history in his lungs, trying to say something new.  

Wayne Shorter leans forward. He hears the question. He wants to answer it.  

You’ve made the doorway. Now, he wants to walk through.
