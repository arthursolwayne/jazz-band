### **Bar 1: Little Ray on Drums**  
**Purpose:** Set the mood — sparse, but full of tension.  
- **Kick:** On beats 1 and 3 (strong, punchy)  
- **Snare:** On beats 2 and 4 (crisp, dry)  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (tight, consistent, like a heartbeat)  
- **Fill:** On the & of 3, a short brush stroke on the snare, fading out.  
- **Dynamics:** Start soft, build slightly by the end of the bar.  
- **Feel:** Like the room is holding its breath.

### **Bars 2–4: Full Quartet Enters, You on Tenor Take the Melody**

#### **Bar 2:**
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Dm7 walking line, chromatic approach to D.  
**Line:**  
D – C – Bb – B – C – D – Eb – F – G – A – Bb – B – C – D  
(Starts on the downbeat, chromatic approach to D on beat 3)

**Diane (Piano):**  
Dm7 (D – F – A – C) on beat 2, then a diminished 7 on beat 4 (F – Ab – Bb – Db)  
- Space between chords, sharp and emotional.

**You (Tenor):**  
Start the motif:  
**Phrase 1 (Bar 2):**  
**Dm7 (D – F – A – C)**  
Play: D (low), F (upper register), A (soprano), C (high F)  
- Short, lyrical, like a question.  
- End on **C**, leaving it hanging — incomplete.

#### **Bar 3:**
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Continues walking line, chromatic to G.  
**Line:**  
G – F# – F – E – D – Eb – F – G – A – Bb – B – C – D – E

**Diane (Piano):**  
Gm7 on beat 2, then Bm7 on beat 4  
- Keep it sparse, let the space speak.

**You (Tenor):**  
**Phrase 2 (Bar 3):**  
Echo and expand the first phrase.  
Play: F (lower register), A (mid), C (high), D (upper)  
- More confident, more complete.  
- Ends on **D**, resolving slightly but still open-ended.

#### **Bar 4:**
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line, chromatic to C.  
**Line:**  
C – B – Bb – A – G – G# – A – B – C – D – Eb – E – F – G

**Diane (Piano):**  
Cm7 on beat 2, then E7 on beat 4  
- Sharp, emotional, with tension.

**You (Tenor):**  
**Phrase 3 (Bar 4):**  
Complete the motif.  
Play: D (low), F (mid), A (high), C (upper)  
- Full, strong, but with a subtle rest before the final note.  
- End on **C**, held just a hair longer — a whisper that lingers.

### **Final Note:**
You hold that **C** for a split second, then let it go.  
The room is silent.  
Wayne Shorter sits up.  
He listens.

**That’s your intro.**
