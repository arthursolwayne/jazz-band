### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums) – Setup the Tension**

**Kit Elements:**
- Kick: On beat 1 and 3 (F, D)
- Snare: On beat 2 and 4 (Ab, F)
- Hi-hat: On every eighth note (6/8 time feel, but syncopated slightly on the off-beats)
- Fill: A short, open-ended roll on the snare before the downbeat of bar 2, building anticipation

**Mood:** The room holds its breath. The silence before a storm.

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters – Diane (Piano) – First Chord**

**Chord:** C7#9 (Ab, C, E, G, Bb)  
**Voicing:** Open, spread out — left hand Ab-E, right hand C-G-Bb  
**Comping:** Diane plays on beat 2 and 4, with a chromatic approach from Bb to C

**Mood:** The first spark. A suggestion of something unresolved. The color is smoky, with a sharp edge.

### **Bar 3: Diane (Piano) – Second Chord**

**Chord:** Bb7#11 (F, Bb, D, F, A)  
**Voicing:** Open, with a suspended 4th (F-A), then resolved to Bb-D  
**Comping:** Same pattern — on beat 2 and 4, with a chromatic approach from A to Bb

**Mood:** It’s a little off-kilter. The harmony is familiar, but the tension is new.

### **Bar 4: Marcus (Bass) – Root and Fifth with Chromatic Approach, Diane (Piano) – Final Chord, You (Sax) – Your Motif**

**Marcus:**
- Root: F (D2)  
- Fifth: C (F2)  
- Chromatic approach: Eb (E2) → F (D2)  
- Walking line: Eb - F - Ab - Bb  
- Ends on Bb (Ab2), preparing the next phrase

**Diane:**
**Chord:** Ab7#9 (F, Ab, C, Eb, Gb)  
**Voicing:** F-Gb, Ab-Eb, C  
**Comping:** Resolves on the last beat of bar 4, with a sustained Ab in the right hand

**You (Sax):**
**Motif (Fm scale, but with a twist):**
- F – Gb – Ab – Bb  
- End on Bb, leaving the resolution hanging  
- Phrasing: Smooth and breathy, like a question being asked in the dark

**Mood:** The question is out there. The room is alive. Wayne leans forward.

**Final Note:** The last Bb from your sax is held just long enough to make the air in the room hold its breath — and then it’s time to go.
