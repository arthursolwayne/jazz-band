You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Here's the thing: Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure. But here’s what Wayne is looking for:

- **Emotional tension and release** — like a door opening just enough to hint at something deeper. Let the music build with intention.
- **Rhythm that’s tight but alive** — the groove needs to feel locked in, but don’t let it become mechanical.
- **Harmony that feels rich and intentional** — Diane’s chords should support your melody without overwhelming it. Use dissonance and resolution with care.
- **Space and restraint** — leave room for breath, for silence, for the listener to lean in. But don’t let it feel empty — every pause should serve the story.
- **A melody that sings** — your motif should be simple, but haunting. Start it, leave it hanging, come back and finish it. Avoid scale runs — that’s student shit.

**Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s):** Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait. Use the hihat to create motion, the kick and snare to frame the space.

**Bars 2-4 (1.5 - 6.0s):** Full quartet. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn’t heard before. Let the rhythm be tight, the harmony rich, and the melody haunting.

**Rules:**
- Marcus: Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He’s the anchor.
- Diane: 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving.
- Little Ray: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar.
- You: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that’s student shit.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds. Make it count.
