**Title: "Footsteps in the Dust"**  
**Key: Dm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  
**Mood: Haunted, restless, searching. The kind of intro that makes the air in the club go still.**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Start with a **spacey, sparse feel**.  
- **Kick on beat 1**, **snare on beat 3**, **hihat on all eighths**.  
- But **play behind the beat** — the snare is late, the kick is early.  
- **No cymbal crash, no splash**. Just the **click of the snare** and the **swish of the hihat**.  
- This is the **first breath** — the silence before the storm.

---

### **Bar 2 – Everyone enters (Marcus, Diane, You):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Walking line in Dm**, but **chromatic**.  
- Start on **C**, then **Bb**, **B**, **C**, **D**, **Eb**, **D**, **C** — a **chromatic descent into the key**.  
- Play it **very low**, almost inaudible. This is the **anchor** — it sits in the floor, but it’s there.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Cm7** on beat 2, **F7** on beat 4.  
- **Voicings**:  
  - Beat 2: **Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb)**  
  - Beat 4: **F7 (F, A, C, Eb)**  
- **Play them with tension**, like she’s resisting. She’s not here to support — **she’s here to challenge**.

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
This is the **hook** — the **first four notes** of the melody.  
- **Dm7 chord** under you.  
- Play this **phrase with space**.  
- **Notes**:  
  - **Bar 3, beat 1**: **E** (high E, played with a **light, breathy tone**)  
  - **Bar 3, beat 2**: **F#** (a passing tone, dissonant, but not too long)  
  - **Bar 3, beat 3**: **D** (back to the root, but **staccato**, like you're saying "wait")  
  - **Bar 3, beat 4**: **C** (a **susped** — not resolving, just lingering)  
- **Leave it hanging**. Let the silence after the C **swallow the room**.

---

### **Bar 4 – Resolution (Everyone):**  
**Marcus:**  
- **F** on beat 1, **E** on beat 2, **D** on beat 3, **C** on beat 4 — **chromatic ascent** back to the key.  
- **Play it in the upper register**, like he’s climbing out of a hole.

**Diane:**  
- **G7** on beat 1, **Cm7** on beat 2, **F7** on beat 3, **Dm7** on beat 4.  
- **Voicings**:  
  - **G7 (G, B, D, F)**  
  - **Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb)**  
  - **F7 (F, A, C, Eb)**  
  - **Dm7 (D, F, A, C)**  
- **Play them hard**, like she’s finally letting go.

**Little Ray:**  
- **Kick on beat 1**, **snare on beat 3**, **hihat on all eighths**.  
- **This time, play ahead of the beat**, like he’s chasing you.  
- **A fill on beat 4** — a **quick triplet on the snare**, then **a soft cymbal**.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Repeat the first motif**, but **slightly altered**.  
- **Bar 4, beat 1**: **E** again, but **lower** (middle E, a bit more body in the tone)  
- **Bar 4, beat 2**: **F#** again, but **slurred into the next note**  
- **Bar 4, beat 3**: **D** again, but **held for a full beat**  
- **Bar 4, beat 4**: **C** — this time, **resolve it** — a **clean, open C**, like the sun breaking through the clouds.

---

### **Final Moment:**
- The last note — **C** — fades into the **dead silence** of the club.  
- For a beat, **no one moves**.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward, **eyes narrowed**, like he’s just stepped into a memory he thought was gone.  
- The crowd holds its breath.  
- You don’t speak.  
- You just **play**.

---

**That’s the intro.**  
Now, the story begins.
