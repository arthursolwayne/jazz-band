**Dante Russo – “Whisper of the Cellar”**  
*4 bars, D minor, 160 BPM, 4/4, 6.0 seconds per 4 bars*  
*Key: D minor, Tonal Center: D, but with a haunting, unresolved feel*

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth, but with a *dampened, tense* sound.  
**Fill:** On the & of 3 – a quick, sharp rimshot, then a ghost note on the snare.  
**Feel:** A slow build. Build tension with space. Don’t resolve. Just *wait*.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

#### **Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line (D2-G2, MIDI 38-43)**
- **D2** (1)  
- **F2** (2) – with a sharp chromatic approach from E2  
- **G2** (3)  
- **Bb2** (4) – with a chromatic approach from A2  
**Rhythm:** Even, snappy, but with subtle dynamic shifts. Emphasize the 3rd beat slightly.

#### **Diane (Piano)**  
- **Bar 2:** Dm7 (D-F-A-C)  
  - Open voicing, left hand on D and F, right hand on A and C.  
  - Play on the 2nd and 4th beats, with a *sighing* dynamic.  
- **Bar 3:** G7 (G-B-D-F) – altered, with a flat 9 on A  
  - Resolve on the 4th beat.  
- **Bar 4:** Cm7 (C-Eb-G-Bb) – open voicing, with a little tension in the Eb  
  - Resolve on the 4th beat, but leave it *hanging*.

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif (Bar 2):**
- **D** (1)  
- **F** (2)  
- **G** (3)  
- **Rest** (4)  
**Phrasing:** Play the first three notes with a smooth, legato feel, then *leave it open*. Let the rest of the band *answer*.

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**
- **F2** (1)  
- **A2** (2) – with a chromatic approach from G2  
- **Bb2** (3)  
- **D3** (4) – with a chromatic approach from C3  
**Dynamic:** Slightly louder than Bar 2, but still grounded.

#### **Diane (Piano)**
- **Bar 3:** G7#9 (G-B-D-F-A) – altered, with a sharp 9 on A  
  - Comp on the 2nd and 4th beats.  
  - Play it *angry* – the chords are sharp, with a dissonance that feels like a question.

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax)**
- **Repeat the motif**, but this time end it on the **& of 3**, and *leave the 4th beat open*.  
- **Motif (Bar 3):**  
  - **D** (1)  
  - **F** (2)  
  - **G** (3)  
  - **Rest** (4)  
**Phrasing:** Same three notes, but with more *weight* and *space* in the last bar.

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**
- **Bb2** (1)  
- **D3** (2) – with a chromatic approach from C3  
- **F3** (3)  
- **A3** (4) – with a chromatic approach from G3  
**Dynamic:** Slightly louder, but still *controlled*. The anchor must be present.

#### **Diane (Piano)**
- **Bar 4:** Cm7 (C-Eb-G-Bb) – open voicing, with a little tension in the Eb  
  - Resolve on the 4th beat, but leave it *hanging*.  
  - Play it *angry* and *open* – let the chords speak with emotion.

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax)**
- **Finish the motif** on the 4th beat.  
- **Motif (Bar 4):**  
  - **D** (1)  
  - **F** (2)  
  - **G** (3)  
  - **D** (4) – *sustained*, with a *swell* at the end  
**Phrasing:** Bring the motif full circle, but end it with a *gentle* sustain, like a question that’s been asked and left open.

### **Final Note:**
This is not a setup.  
This is the *beginning* — a question in the dark, a whisper in the cellar, a ghost that walks with you.

Wayne leans forward.  
It’s not about the notes. It’s about what comes next.  
And it’s already happening.

**END OF INTRO**  
*4 bars. 6 seconds. One question. A beginning.*
