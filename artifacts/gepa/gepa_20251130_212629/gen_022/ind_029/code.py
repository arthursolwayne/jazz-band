### BAR 1 – *Little Ray (Drums)*

**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-Hat:** On every eighth note (open on 1, 3, 5, 7; closed on 2, 4, 6, 8)  
**Fill:** A quick 3-note ride cymbal accent on beat 3  
**Feel:** Tense, urgent, but not rushed. The kind of groove that makes you remember where you left your heart.

### BAR 2 – *Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line*

**Notes (F melodic minor):**  
F – G – Ab – Bb – B – C – Db – Eb – F  
**Rhythm:**  
Quarter note (F)  
Eighth note (G)  
Eighth note (Ab)  
Quarter note (Bb)  
Eighth note (B)  
Eighth note (C)  
Quarter note (Db)

**Phrasing:** Smooth, legato, with a chromatic approach to Bb (Ab to Bb), and an unexpected resolution to Db.

### BAR 3 – *Diane (Piano) – Comping*

**Chords:**  
**Measure 2 – 4:**  
- **2:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
- **3:** G7 (G, B, D, F)  
- **4:** C7 (C, E, G, Bb)  
**Voicings:**  
- F7: Rootless (A, C, Eb, F)  
- G7: Rootless (B, D, F, G)  
- C7: Rootless (E, G, Bb, C)  
**Style:** Swinging, aggressive, with a slight rubato feel on the 3rd beat of each chord. A little dissonance on the G7 (B and F clash slightly), but it’s intentional — she’s angry, remember?

---

### BAR 4 – *You (Tenor Sax) – Melody*

**Motif (F major scale with blue notes):**  
**Notes:**  
F – G – Bb – B – C – Eb – F  
**Rhythm:**  
Quarter (F)  
Eighth (G)  
Quarter (Bb)  
Eighth (B)  
Quarter (C)  
Eighth (Eb)  
**Phrasing:**  
- Start with a breathy F, almost a sigh  
- G is a clean, bright step up  
- Bb is the first blues note, a question  
- B is the answer — but it's not resolved  
- C is a moment of clarity  
- Eb is the fall back into the unknown  
- End on F, but leave it open — just a breath, no vibrato, no resolution

**Dynamic:** Starts soft, builds to a mid-range peak on B, then falls back to a whisper on Eb, ends on F with no resolution.

**Final Note:**  
You let the last F hang. Silence for a beat or two. The room holds. Wayne Shorter raises his glass. It's not the melody he expects, but it's something new — something worth following.

**Done.**
