**Intro – "The Moment"**  
**Key: D**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  
**Mood: Tense, searching, longing. A whisper before the storm.**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Hi-hat on every eighth note, kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.*

- **0.00s - 1.50s:**  
  *Open hi-hat, light kick on 1, snare on 2, kick on 3, snare on 4.  
  The rhythm is there, but sparse. The room holds its breath.*  
  **(Rest for the band, but the beat is set.)**

---

### **Bar 2 – Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **D** → **F#** (chromatic approach)  
- **A** → **B** (chromatic approach)  
- **C#** → **D** (chromatic approach)  
- **F#** → **G** (chromatic approach)  
*Walking line, every note a question, every resolution a lie. The bass is the anchor, but it's not steady. It’s searching.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - **Beat 1:** **D7 (D–F#–A–C#)**  
  - **Beat 2:** **F#7 (F#–A#–C#–E)**  
  - **Beat 3:** **A7 (A–C#–E–G)**  
  - **Beat 4:** **B7 (B–D#–F#–A)**  
*Comp on 2 and 4, 7th chords, each with a touch of dissonance and color. She’s not just playing chords — she’s painting the air with tension.*

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif (D–E–F#–G):**  
- **Beat 1:** D (quarter note)  
- **Beat 2:** E (eighth note)  
- **Beat 3:** F# (eighth note)  
- **Beat 4:** Rest  
*Your first note is a question. The second is a whisper. The third is a memory. The fourth is silence. You leave it hanging — a thread. The room is still, but the energy is electric.*

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax – Return)**  
**Motif (F#–G–A–B):**  
- **Beat 1:** F# (quarter note)  
- **Beat 2:** G (eighth note)  
- **Beat 3:** A (eighth note)  
- **Beat 4:** B (half note)  
*You come back, higher, darker, with a resolution that feels like a promise — or a lie. The B hangs, long and deliberate. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The intro is done. The story is waiting.*

---

### **Final Note (Bar 4, Beat 4):**  
- **B (half note)** — held for the full duration of the bar.  
- *The silence after it stretches. The room is no longer just listening — it’s breathing with you. The set is yours.*

---

**Result:**  
A simple, emotional motif. A question. A pause. A return. A promise.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward. You’ve made him listen.
