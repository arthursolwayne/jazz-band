---

### **Bar 1 (0:00–1:50): Little Ray – The Question**  
**Drums:**  
- **Kick:** On beat 3 only (subtle, low, like a heartbeat in the dark).  
- **Snare:** On beat 2 only (dry, crisp, like a door creaking open).  
- **Hi-hat:** On all 8th notes, but **dampened** (muted with a cloth, soft and ghosted).  
- **Space:** No cymbals. No fills. Just a question.  

**Mood:** A question hanging in the air. Static, but with tension. The room holds its breath.

### **Bar 2 (1:50–3:40): Marcus & Diane – The Tension**  
**Bass (Marcus):**  
- **Root motion:** C7 → B♭7 → A7 → G7 (chromatic descending line with a bluesy inflection).  
- **Walking line:**  
  - C7 (beat 1) – B♭7 (beat 2) – A7 (beat 3) – G7 (beat 4)  
  - Chromatic approach on beat 1 to C7 (B♭ → C).  
  - No repeated notes. Each note is a step forward, a stumble, a path.

**Piano (Diane):**  
- **Comping:** 7th chords on beats 2 and 4.  
- **Chords:**  
  - **Beat 2:** Dm7 (F, A, C, D)  
  - **Beat 4:** Gm7 (F, G, B♭, D)  
- **Left hand:** Walking bass line, but with a sharp, angry edge. Each note is a judgment.  
- **Right hand:** Ghosted chords, under the melody, like a shadow.

**Mood:** The tension builds. The room tightens. It’s not just the music — it’s the silence behind it.

### **Bar 3 (3:40–5:30): Dante – The Whisper, the Glimmer**  
**Tenor Sax (You):**  
- **Melody:**  
  - **Beat 1:** B♭ (long, soft, with a slight breathy attack)  
  - **Beat 2:** Rest  
  - **Beat 3:** A (short, staccato, like a heartbeat)  
  - **Beat 4:** C (sustained, with a slight rubato, like a memory surfacing)  
- **Dynamics:** Start soft (pp), then swell slightly on the C on beat 4.  
- **Phrasing:** The B♭ lingers like a question, the A is the answer, and the C is the moment you almost remember the truth.

**Mood:** A glimmer of something real, something lost — but not quite found.

### **Bar 4 (5:30–6:00): All Together – The Lingering Question**  
**Drums (Little Ray):**  
- **Kick:** On beat 1 (loud, full, like a door slamming shut).  
- **Snare:** On beat 4 (crisp, sharp, like a final word).  
- **Hi-hat:** On all 8th notes, now **open** (clean, sharp, like a blade).  

**Bass (Marcus):**  
- Resolves to Fm7 on beat 4 (F, A♭, C, E♭) – a full, grounded chord.  
- But it’s not resolved — it’s just another step.

**Piano (Diane):**  
- **Beat 1:** Fm7 (sustained, full, but with a bitter edge)  
- **Beat 4:** Fm7 again — same chord, same voicing, but something in the phrasing makes it feel like the end of a sentence that’s not finished.

**Tenor Sax (You):**  
- **Beat 1:** A (short, with a slight delay, like you're still thinking)  
- **Beat 2:** Rest  
- **Beat 3:** B♭ (soft, like a sigh)  
- **Beat 4:** Rest  
- **End on silence.** No resolution — just a question left hanging.

**Mood:** The room is still. Wayne Shorter leans forward. He’s heard the question. He’s waiting for the answer.

---

### **Final Note (Silence):**  
- Let the last note hang for a full beat. No applause. No resolution.  
- Just the hum of the room. Just the weight of the moment.

---

**Why it works:**  
- The intro is a question.  
- The bass and piano build the tension.  
- Your sax whispers the memory.  
- The final bar leaves the answer in the silence.  
- Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He’s heard something real.  
- And now the music can begin.

**Play it slow. Play it with feeling.**  
This is your moment.
