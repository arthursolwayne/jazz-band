- D → F# → G → A → B (chromatic approach to B)  
- D → E → F# → G (chromatic approach to G again)

- Bar 2: **D7 (D, F#, A, C#)** – played on beat **2**  
- Bar 3: **G7 (G, B, D, F#)** – played on beat **4**  
- Subtle, sparse comping – just enough to push the air forward.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same pattern as Bar 1, but **slightly louder**, still restrained.  
- Hihat on every eighth, kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.

### **Final Moment – Silence**  
- Everyone holds for a full second after the last note.  
- No applause, no talk – just the sound of thirty people breathing in unison.

- He leans forward.
