### **Bar 1 – The Question**  
**Drums (Little Ray):**  
- Kick on **beat 1** (strong, muted, low).  
- Snare on **beat 3** (sharp, crisp, slightly behind the beat).  
- Hi-hat: eighth notes on **1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &**, but slightly off-kilter — a bit behind on the "2" and "4" to create tension.  
- **Rhythm:** [Kick (1) | Hi-hat (1 & 2) | Snare (3) | Hi-hat (3 & 4)]  
- **Feel:** Suspenseful, like the opening of a door.

**Bass (Marcus):**  
- Chromatic walk down from **Bb** to **F** on beats 1–4.  
- Notes: **Bb – Ab – G – F**  
- **Rhythm:** Walking quarter notes, smooth and deliberate.  
- **Dynamic:** Sustained, but soft, like a whisper.

**Piano (Diane):**  
- No notes. A rest.  
- **Purpose:** Emphasizes the silence, the anticipation.  
- **Mood:** Tension builds.

**Sax (you):**  
- **Rest.**  
- **Purpose:** The silence is more powerful than the sound.  
- **Mood:** Mystery. Suspense.

- Kick on **1 and 3** (same as before, but now slightly more insistent).  
- Snare on **2 and 4** (same placement, but with more attack).  
- Hi-hat: eighth notes, now more even, but with a slight rub against the kick.  
- **Feel:** Building, searching, urgency.

**Bass (Marcus):**  
- Chromatic walk **up** from **F** to **Bb**.  
- Notes: **F – G – Ab – Bb**  
- **Rhythm:** Quarter notes, ascending.

**Piano (Diane):**

- **Left hand:** Root and fifth (F and C) on **beat 2 and 4**, spaced apart.  
- **Right hand:** Upper structure (A and Eb) with a sharp, staccato attack.  
- **Dynamic:** Aggressive, angry, but concise.

**Sax (you):**  
- **Melody:** One short, ascending motif.  
- Notes: **F – G – Bb** (a major third up, then a minor third down)  
- **Rhythm:** Quarter, eighth, eighth.  
- **Dynamic:** Soft to medium, with a slight crescendo on the Bb.  
- **Purpose:** A fragment of a melody — a question in sound.

- **Left hand:** Root (F) on 2, fifth (C) on 4.  
- **Right hand:** 9th (A) on 2, 11th (Db) on 4.  
- **Dynamic:** Slightly softer, but still intense — like a quiet storm.

**Sax (you):**  
- **Melody:** Repeat the F – G – Bb motif.  
- **Dynamic:** Slightly softer, with a breath between the last note.  
- **Purpose:** A memory, a return — the question answered, but not entirely.
