**Title: "Doorway in F"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6.0 seconds (4 bars)**

---

**BAR 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Set the tone with a slow, deliberate build.*

- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
- **Fill:** A small, open-ended brush stroke on the snare at the end of the bar — like a question mark.

---

**BAR 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, roots and fifths with chromatic approaches.*

- **F (root), G (fifth), G# (chromatic approach), A (root), Bb (chromatic), B (fifth), B (chromatic), C (root)**  
- Play with a slow, deliberate feel, letting the tension build.

---

**BAR 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Open voicings, changing chords each bar, resolving on the last beat.*

- **Chord:** Fmaj7 (F, A, C, E)  
- Voicing: Open, spaced out — left hand plays F and C, right hand plays A and E, with a slight F# in the upper register for color.  
- Comp on beats 2 and 4.  
- Ends with a *Fmaj7* chord resolving on beat 4.

---

**BAR 2 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Same pattern as bar 1, but slightly more aggressive — the tension is rising.*

---

**BAR 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Continuing the walking line with chromatic tension.*

- **C (root), D (fifth), D# (chromatic), Eb (root), F (chromatic), G (fifth), G (chromatic), A (root)**  
- Maintain the same rhythm and feel, but with a subtle push forward.

---

**BAR 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
*New chord: D7sus4 (D, G, A, C#)*

- Voicing: Open, with a slight dissonance — left hand D and A, right hand G and C#.  
- Comp on beats 2 and 4.  
- Ends with a *D7sus4* on beat 4 — unresolved, but full of potential.

---

**BAR 3 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Same energy as before, but now the tension is palpable.*

---

**BAR 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Your moment. One short motif. Make it sing. Make it remember.*

- **Motif:**  
  - **Bar 4, beat 1:** F (quarter note)  
  - **Bar 4, beat 2:** G# (eighth note)  
  - **Bar 4, beat 3:** Rest  
  - **Bar 4, beat 4:** A (half note)  

- Play it with a *question* in your tone — like a memory whistling through a cracked window.  
- Let it hang on the rest, then resolve on the A — not too loud, not too quiet.

---

**Final Image:**  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward in the back, whiskey in hand, eyes closed.  
- The room holds its breath.  
- The doorway is open.  
- Something new is about to walk through.

---

**Key Takeaway:**  
This is not a beginning — it’s a *threshold*.  
And you just walked through it.
