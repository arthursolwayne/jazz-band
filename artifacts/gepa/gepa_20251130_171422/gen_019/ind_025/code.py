**Title:** *"First Light"*

**Key:** Dm (D minor)  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Mood:** Quiet intensity, searching, anticipation

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit:** Snare, kick, hihat (closed)  
**Rhythm:**  
- Kick on beats 1 and 3  
- Snare on beats 2 and 4  
- Hihat on all eighths  
- **Rests:** Leave the first two eighths of the bar open — silence, tension, expectation  
- The first hit is on the "and" of 1 (offbeat), then kick on beat 1  
- By the end of the bar, the hihat is going, the snare is snappy, but the kick is holding back — like a heartbeat waiting to begin

---

### **Bar 2 – Quartet Enters**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- Dm7 chord (D, F, Ab, C) written as a walking line  
- Start on the "and" of 1: **Ab** (G#)  
- Beat 1: **C**  
- "And" of 2: **F**  
- Beat 2: **D**  
- "And" of 3: **Ab**  
- Beat 3: **C**  
- "And" of 4: **F**  
- Beat 4: **D**  
- **Chromatic motion** in the passing tones, never repeating the same note  
- The line is steady, grounded, but it feels like it's *pulling* the melody forward

#### **Diane (Piano)**  
**Comping:**  
- Use **Dm7** (D, F, Ab, C)  
- Play **7th chords** on the offbeats  
- "And" of 1: **Fm7** (F, Ab, C, Eb)  
- Beat 1: **Dm7**  
- "And" of 2: **G7** (G, B, D, F)  
- Beat 2: **Dm7**  
- "And" of 3: **Fm7**  
- Beat 3: **Dm7**  
- "And" of 4: **G7**  
- Beat 4: **Dm7**  
- The chords are **angry**, but they’re behind the melody — supporting, not overpowering  
- She’s not playing for herself, she’s playing for the story

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
**Line:**  
- Start on the **"and" of 1** with a **D**, a low, dark note  
- Play a **four-note motif**:  
  **D - Eb - F - G** (melodic minor, D Dorian)  
- Let it hang on the **"and" of 2**  
- Then **rest** on beat 2  
- On the **"and" of 3**, play **Eb again**, then **F**, then **G**, forming the same shape  
- End on the **"and" of 4** with a **G**, then **rest** on beat 4  
- That’s it — the rest is silence  
- It’s not a run, it’s a **question**, a **search**, a **beginning**

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus and Diane continue**  
**Marcus:** Keep the same walking line  
**Diane:** Repeat the same comping pattern  
**Little Ray:** Same beat, same energy, same tension  
**Dante:** Rests — silence again, but the space is full

---

### **Bar 4 – Dante Answers**  
**Line:**  
- Start on the **"and" of 1** with a **D**, again  
- Play the same **four-note motif**  
- This time, **end on the beat** with a **G**  
- Then, **hold** that G for a full bar — not a run, not a cry, just a **sigh**  
- The rest of the quartet resolves with the last chord — **Dm7**  
- Diane and Marcus hold the chord  
- Little Ray brings the beat in — snare, kick, hihat  
- And the room holds its breath

---

### **Final Moment**  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
The room is still.  
Dm7 hangs.  
The story has begun.

**End of Intro**  
**"First Light"** is not a song — it’s an invitation.  
And you’ve made it feel like a beginning.
