---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*The silence is thick. The room holds its breath.*  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth (closed, tight, no splash)  
- **No fill. No cymbal. Just the heartbeat.**  
- *The beat is there. It’s not loud. It’s waiting.*

---

**Bar 2 – All In:**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)**  
- Chromatic descent from D to C to Bb  
- Then a walk:  
  - Ab → G → F# → F (on beat 1)  
  - Bb → A → G → F (beat 2)  
  - C → B → Bb → A (beat 3)  
  - D → C → B → Bb (beat 4)  
- *He’s not walking. He’s unraveling. The bass is a thread, pulling*.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Fm7 on beat 2, C7 on beat 4**  
- F, Ab, C, D on beat 2  
- C, E, G, B on beat 4  
- No comp in between. Let the silence do the work.  
- *She’s not playing for rhythm. She’s playing for emotion. The chords are like accusations.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif: F → Ab → C → F**  
- Smooth, legato, but *incomplete*  
- The note F lingers on the last beat — unresolved  
- *He’s not showing you the whole thing. He’s giving you a taste of something he’s not ready to name.*

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
- **Fm7 again on beat 2**  
- She adds a trill on the Ab in the chord — like a whisper  
- *It’s not a mistake. It’s a question.*

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Fm7: F, Ab, C, D**  
- Chromatic approach again: E → F (beat 1)  
- Then a sliding walk:  
  - Ab → G → F (beat 2)  
  - C → B → Bb (beat 3)  
  - D → C → B (beat 4)  
- *He’s not anchoring. He’s dancing on the edge of the fall.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Repeat the motif, but this time end on Ab**  
- F → Ab → C → Ab  
- *Now it’s a question. Now it’s a challenge.*

---

**Bar 4 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3 again  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth  
- **One small fill on beat 4: a ghost note on the snare, just before the last chord**

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Fm7 on beat 2, D7 on beat 4 (with a Bb in the chord)**  
- F, Ab, C, D on beat 2  
- D, F#, A, Bb on beat 4  
- *The tension is building. She’s not resolving. She’s reaching.*

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Fm7: F, Ab, C, D**  
- Then a chromatic run from D up to F  
- *He’s pulling the floor out from under you.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Final motif: F → Ab → C → D**  
- Smooth, legato, but with a *bite* on the D  
- *He ends it. He doesn’t finish it. He leaves it hanging, like a promise.*

**End of the Intro.**  
*The room is still. The whiskey is still. Wayne Shorter leans forward just a bit.*  
*This is the moment. The one that comes once in a lifetime.*
