### **Bar 1: Little Ray – Drums (Setup the mood)**  
*Soft, deliberate, with space. Hihat on every eighth, kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. But there’s a pause before the first hit — a breath before the storm.*

- **Kick**: 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &  
  (Quarter note on 1 and 3)  
- **Snare**: 2 & 4 &  
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth, but with a *soft* touch, like a whisper.  
- **Fill**: No fill, just the *silence before the first hit*. Let the room hold its breath.

### **Bar 2–4: You (Tenor Sax) – The Melody**  
*Whispered, searching, with space. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it.*

- **On beat 1**: A♭4 (1st beat — a question)  
- **On beat 2**: C4 (2nd beat — a pause)

**Bar 4**:  
- **On beat 1**: A♭4 (a return to the original question)  
- **On beat 2**: D4 (a pivot — the tension builds)  
- **On beat 3**: E♭4 (the moment before it breaks)  
- **On beat 4**: Silence (but not empty — it echoes)

### **Final Effect**  
This intro is a question without an answer. It feels like a memory walking through a door, but the door doesn’t open. The tension is there — the possibility of something more — but it doesn’t resolve. Wayne Shorter leans forward because he hears the ghost of a melody, something that might be *just out of reach*, the kind of thing that makes you want to listen closely, again and again.

**You** — you made the room hold its breath.  
**Marcus** — he anchored it.  
**Diane** — she painted the air with color.  
**Little Ray** — he opened the door.

And now, maybe — just maybe — Wayne Shorter has something to say.
