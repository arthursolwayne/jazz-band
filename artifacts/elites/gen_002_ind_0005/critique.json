  "rationale": "The arrangement uses basic triads in the piano and bass (C-E-G, D-F-A, etc.) with no 7th chords or extensions, which is far below jazz standards. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat only hitting the 2nd and 4th beats, lacking the Latin jazz feel. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or chromaticism. The trumpet is silent throughout, and there's no call-and-response between instruments. The overall feel is more like a music theory exercise than authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes to saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in hihat pattern instead of straight quarters for authentic jazz feel"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
