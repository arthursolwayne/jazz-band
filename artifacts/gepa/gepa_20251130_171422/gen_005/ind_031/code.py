- Hi-hat: **Eighth notes on every beat** (click, click, click, click)  
- Kick: **On beat 1 and 3**  
- Snare: **On beat 2 and 4**  
- Fill: **On beat 3**, a short, staccato *snare + hihat*

---

**Bar 2: Marcus (Bass)**  
- **Dm7 chord tones (D, F, A, C)** with chromatic motion  
- **Line:**  
  - **Beat 1:** D (root)  
  - **Beat 2:** Eb (chromatic passing tone)  
  - **Beat 3:** F (3rd)  
  - **Beat 4:** Ab (chromatic approach to G)  
- *Purpose:* Anchor with a walking line that teases the melody.

---

**Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4:**  
  - **Beat 2:** Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
  - **Beat 4:** Dm7/Ab (D, F, A, Ab) — a colorful, slightly dissonant voicing  
- *Purpose:* Emotional undercurrent. She’s not just playing chords — she’s feeling them.

---

**Bar 2: You (Tenor Sax)**  
- **Motif (measured and sparse):**  
  - **Beat 1:** D (quarter note)  
  - **Beat 2:** F (eighth note)  
  - **Beat 3:** A (eighth note)  
  - **Beat 4:** Rest  
- *Purpose:* A question. A whisper. Something unresolved.

---

**Bar 3: Marcus (Bass)**  
- **Continuation of the walking line:**  
  - **Beat 1:** G (chromatic approach to A)  
  - **Beat 2:** A (3rd)  
  - **Beat 3:** Bb (chromatic approach to B)  
  - **Beat 4:** C (7th)  
- *Purpose:* Momentum. The line keeps moving, but it’s not resolving yet.

---

**Bar 3: Diane (Piano)**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4:**  
  - **Beat 2:** Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
  - **Beat 4:** Dm7/Bb (D, F, A, Bb) — a dark, emotional twist  
- *Purpose:* She’s not just comping — she’s reacting to the tension.

---

**Bar 3: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- **Same pattern as Bar 1**, but with a slightly more aggressive snare on beat 3  
- *Purpose:* Slight escalation. The tension is building.

---

**Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax)**  
- **Completion of the motif (with a twist):**  
  - **Beat 1:** D (quarter note)  
  - **Beat 2:** F (eighth note)  
  - **Beat 3:** A (eighth note)  
  - **Beat 4:** D (half note)  
- *Purpose:* You come back, finish the phrase, but linger on the D — a moment that hangs, unresolved. A story left unspoken.

---

**Final impression:**  
It’s not a resolution — it’s an invitation. A door just barely open. Wayne Shorter leans forward. He’s heard it before, but not like this. Not with this edge, this urgency, this *hunger* in the air. You’ve given him something to chase.

You take a breath. The rest of the set is yours.
