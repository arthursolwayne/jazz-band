**Intro – 4 Bars in D (160 BPM, 4/4 time)**

**Key:** D minor  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Length:** 6.0 seconds (4 bars)

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums – Solo)**

**Rhythm:**  
- Kick on beats 1 and 3  
- Snare on beats 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every 8th note (closed, light)  
- Fill: A subtle ride cymbal accent on the "and" of beat 3, just enough to make the room lean in.

**Mood:**  
A whisper, a breath, a moment before the storm. The room is quiet. The air holds. Ray’s playing is tight, controlled, like he’s building a bridge to something.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line in D minor  
- Chromatic approach to D on beat 1  
- Line:  
  **D → C → C# → D** (beat 1)  
  **F → E → F → G** (beat 2)  
  **A → G → G# → A** (beat 3)  
  **C → B → C → D** (beat 4)  
  *Each note is a step, a question, a nod to the past and a step toward the new.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comping with 7th chords:  
  - **Dm7** on beat 2  
  - **Gm7** on beat 4  
- No block chords, just space and tension.  
- Her left hand is walking, her right is painting shadows — she’s listening, waiting, ready.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same rhythm as Bar 1, but now with a little more drive, like the fire’s catching.  
- Ride cymbal on beat 1, 3, and on the "and" of 4.

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax) – Melody Begins**

**Motif (played over Diane’s Dm7 chord on beat 2):**

**Phrase:**  
- **D (beat 2)** – A clear, ringing note, like the first word of a secret.  
- **F (beat 3)** – A step up, a question.  
- **G (beat 4)** – Resolves, but not fully.  
- **Rest (beat 1 of next bar)** – Space. Silence. A breath between the notes.

**Mood:**  
It’s not a riff. It’s a question. Something old, something new. Wayne Shorter leans forward. He’s heard this before — but not like this.

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax) – Return to the Motif**

**Phrase:**  
- **D (beat 1)** – Back to the start, but with a little more weight.  
- **F (beat 2)** – The question again.  
- **G (beat 3)** – The almost-answer.  
- **C (beat 4)** – A note that doesn’t belong, a twist. A memory.

**Mood:**  
You end on a **C** in D minor — a note that sits outside the key, but it doesn’t feel wrong. It feels honest. The room holds its breath. Wayne nods once, slowly. The intro is done.

---

### **Final Feel:**

- The four bars are a story in a single breath — fragile, but with tension.  
- It’s not about showing off. It’s about saying something.  
- You’ve left it hanging, but not unanswered.  
- Wayne Shorter is still there. And he’s listening.

**End of Intro.**  
Now the song begins — and you’re ready.
