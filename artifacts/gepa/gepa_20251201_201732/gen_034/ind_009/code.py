**Title: "Doorway"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Time: 4 bars (6.0 seconds)**  
**Mood: Curious, yearning, like a question in the dark.**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (closed), tight and precise  
**Fill:** A single open hi-hat on beat 4, just before the others enter, lingering like a breath held.

---

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass), Diane (Piano), Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Marcus:**  
- D2 (F root) on beat 1  
- G2 (fifth) on beat 2  
- F2 (root) on beat 3  
- G2 (fifth) on beat 4  
- Chromatic approach: E2 on beat 3 (half-step below F)  
*Walking line: D2 – G2 – F2 – E2 – F2*  

**Diane:**  
- Bar 2: Fmaj7 (F, A, C, E)  
- Voicing: F, A, C, E — open, spaced out, with a bit of space between the notes  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4, with a soft accent on beat 4  

**Little Ray:**  
- Same as Bar 1, but with a subtle roll on the snare on beat 2, adding tension.  
- Hihat still tight, but with a hint of swaying feel

---

### **Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax), Marcus, Diane, Little Ray**  
**Marcus:**  
- D2 (F root) on beat 1  
- G2 (fifth) on beat 2  
- F2 on beat 3  
- E2 (chromatic) on beat 4  
*Same line as Bar 2, but now with full ensemble under it*

**Diane:**  
- Bar 3: Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
- Voicing: D, F, A, C — open, with a dark, slightly dissonant feel  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4, with a slight rub against the sax melody

**Little Ray:**  
- Same rhythm, but now with a light ride cymbal on beat 3, adding shimmer  
- Snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- You begin your motif on beat 1:  
  - **F** (beat 1) – a clean, open note, like a question (maybe with a slight breath before it)  
  - **A** (beat 2) – left hanging, but with a soft vibrato  
  - **G** (beat 3) – a step down, like a hesitation  
  - **F** (beat 4) – returns, but not resolved — it's still the same note, but now with a fuller tone  

*This is your question. Not an answer. It lingers, waiting for the rest of the band to respond.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax), Marcus, Diane, Little Ray**  
**Marcus:**  
- Same walking line: D2 – G2 – F2 – E2  
- This time, the line feels like a response to your question — it's there, but just beneath the surface

**Diane:**  
- Bar 4: E7 (E, G#, B, D)  
- Voicing: E, G#, B, D — open, resolving to a dominant seventh, like a breath before the next story  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4, with a soft release on beat 4

**Little Ray:**  
- Same pattern as before, but now with a light cymbal swell on beat 4, like the closing of a door or the opening of a window

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- You repeat your motif, but this time you **finish** it:  
  - F (beat 1) – the same note, but now with a touch of confidence  
  - A (beat 2) – still left hanging, but now with a little more weight  
  - G (beat 3) – the hesitation is still there, but it's not a stop  
  - **F#** (beat 4) – a half-step up, a slight twist, like the first crack in a mirror  
- *You don’t resolve. You don’t answer. You leave the door ajar.*

**End of 4 bars.**

Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He’s heard something he hasn’t heard before.  
Something that feels like a question — and maybe, just maybe, it’s one he wants to answer.
