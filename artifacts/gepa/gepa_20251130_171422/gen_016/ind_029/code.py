**Bar 1 – Drums Only (Little Ray):**  
*(Kick on 1, 3. Snare on 2, 4. Hihat on every eighth, but with dynamic variation.)*

- **Kick:** soft on 1, full on 3  
- **Snare:** crisp but not loud on 2, slightly muted on 4  
- **Hi-hat:** light on 1 & 3, louder on 2 & 4, with a slight swell at the end of the bar  
- **Space:** leave a half-second of silence at the end of the bar to let the room breathe

**Bar 2 – Full Quartet (Dm7 chord):**  
*(Dm7 – F, A, C, D)*

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - D – F# (chromatic approach)  
  - C – B (approach from above)  
  - A – Bb (approach from above, then chromatic descent)  
  - D – Eb (approach from above, then half-step down)  

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - Comp on 2 and 4  
  - 2: Dm7 (D, F, A, C) with a dissonant F# in the left hand  
  - 4: Dm7 (same chord) but with a Bb in the right hand, creating a half-diminished feel  
  - Slight rub on the piano — it’s angry, but it moves

- **You (Sax):**  
  - Start with a short, breathy phrase:  
    - **D – Eb – D** (rest on the final D, leaving it hanging)  
    - Motif: a question  
    - Rest on beat 4 – don’t finish it yet

**Bar 3 – Full Quartet (Dm7 → Gm7):**  
*(Tension builds, modulation into Gm7)*

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - G – A (chromatic up)  
  - F – G (chromatic up)  
  - E – D (chromatic down)  
  - G – F (chromatic down)  

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - Comp on 2 and 4 again  
  - 2: Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F) with a B in the left hand (creating tension)  
  - 4: Gm7 (same chord) but with a C in the right hand, a half-step above the 7th  
  - She’s pushing the harmony, but it’s still moving forward

- **You (Sax):**  
  - Repeat the motif, slightly altered:  
    - **G – Ab – G** (same structure, but in G)  
    - Still leave a rest at the end of the bar  
    - The motif is now a challenge — a question that’s moving

**Bar 4 – Full Quartet (Dm7 → Resolve):**  
*(Resolution with space and emotional depth)*

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - D – F# (chromatic)  
  - C – B (approach from above)  
  - A – G (half-step down)  
  - D – C (chromatic down)  

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - 2: Dm7 with a C in the right hand (a half-step above the 7th, again)  
  - 4: Dm7 with a Bb in the right hand  
  - She’s conflicted, but she’s not holding back

- **You (Sax):**  
  - Return to the original motif:  
    - **D – Eb – D** (now resolved, full breath on the final D)  
    - The motif is no longer a question — it’s an answer  
    - Let the note ring, don’t rush it

**Final Moment:**  
You hold the final D for a full measure — just a breath, just a pause.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
The room holds its breath.  
You’ve made it mean something.

**The intro is done.**  
Now the music can begin.
