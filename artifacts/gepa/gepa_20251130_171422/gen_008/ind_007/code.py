**BAR 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
A single, taut snare hit on beat 2. A ghost note on the hihat on beat 4. Two open hi-hat taps on the & of 1 and & of 3 — *quiet but insistent*. The kick is held back, creating tension. It’s like a breath held before a fall.

**BAR 2 – Full Ensemble Enters (Marcus, Diane, Dante):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Dm7 chord (D-F-Ab-C) on beat 1.  
- Chromatic walk down: C-Bb-B-Ab (beat 2).  
- Fm7 (F-Ab-Bb-D) on beat 3.  
- Then a sharp chromatic run: D-C#-C-Bb (beat 4).  
*He’s leading you in, but not telling you where to go.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on beat 2 with a Dm7 (D-F-Ab-C).  
- Beat 4: a Bbm7 (Bb-D-F-Ab), resolving *away* from the tonic.  
- She’s not just playing rhythm — she’s suggesting a direction, a question.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- Starts with a single, descending 3-note motif:  
  **D → C → Bb**  
  *Sings it with a slight growl, soft and urgent, like a secret whispered.*  
- Ends on the Bb, suspended — the rest of the band holds, waiting.

**BAR 3 – Full Ensemble (Marcus, Diane, Dante):**  
**Marcus:**  
- AAbm7 (Ab-Cb-Eb-Gb) on beat 1.  
- Chromatic run: Gb-G-F-Eb (beat 2).  
- Then a sudden shift to a G7 (G-B-D-F) on beat 3.  
- Beat 4: a ii-V sound in A: Dm7 (D-F-Ab-C) → G7 (G-B-D-F).  
*He’s playing the map, but the destination is still unclear.*

**Diane:**  
- Beat 2: A7 (A-C#-E-G).  
- Beat 4: A7 again, but with a slight rub against the harmony.  
*She’s pushing forward, but with a question in her left hand.*

**Dante:**  
- The motif returns:  
  **D → C → Bb**, but this time, he *trills* the last note — a slick, smooth trill on the Bb.  
  *It’s the same idea, but now it’s a question — answered, but not in the way you expected.*

**BAR 4 – Full Ensemble (Marcus, Diane, Dante):**  
**Marcus:**  
- Beat 1: Dm7 (D-F-Ab-C) again, but this time with a chromatic passing tone: C#-D.  
- Beat 2: A7 (A-C#-E-G) with a Bb in the bass.  
- Beat 3: Dm7 again — but with a rub on the C# in the bass.  
- Beat 4: A7, open-ended, with a Bb in the bass.  
*He's circling back — but not quite to where it started.*

**Diane:**  
- Beat 2: A7 with a Bb in the left hand.  
- Beat 4: A7 again, but with an F in the left hand — dissonance, tension, emotion.  
*She’s not resolving — she’s building.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- The motif returns:  
  **D → C → Bb**, but this time it’s *loud* — a sudden, sharp attack.  
  *He ends it with a quick, breathy release — like a sigh after a question.*  
  *Then — silence. No more. Just the sound of the room holding its breath.*

**End of Intro.**

Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He hasn’t heard this before.  
It's not a song — it's a moment.  
And it's not over yet.
