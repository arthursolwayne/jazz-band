**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth, kick on 1 and 3. The groove is tight, but there's a breath between the hits. The room holds its breath. The beat is there, but it’s waiting for something.*

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line in Dm, starting on the & of 3. Notes: G, F, E♭, D, C, B♭, A, G. Chromatic approach on the B♭ to A. The line is forward, never repeating a note. It’s not just walking — it’s moving through a story.*

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp on 2 and 4. Dm7 on 2 with a B♭ in the upper voice, then Gm7 on 4 with an F in the upper voice. The chords are dark, with tension. She’s not playing the changes — she’s setting up a mood.*

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Continuing the line: F, E♭, D, C, B♭, A, G, F. Chromatic approach again on the A to G. The rhythm shifts slightly, pushing the beat forward. The bass is the heartbeat, steady but alive.*

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp on 2 and 4. Cm7 on 2 with a B♭, then Fm7 on 4 with an E♭. The voicings are rich, with a sense of longing. She’s not just playing chords — she’s painting the space between them.*

**Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Final line: E♭, D, C, B♭, A, G, F, E♭. Chromatic approach again on the D to C. Ends on E♭, resolving to the tonic but not quite landing. The line is complete, but it feels like it's still moving.*

**Bar 4 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp on 2 and 4. Bm7 on 2 with an A, then E7 on 4 with a D. The final chord is sharp, a tritone away from the tonic. It’s a question. It’s a challenge.*

**Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
*Start on the & of 3. Motif: D, E♭, F, D. A simple, haunting line — not a scale run, but a phrase that lingers. Then leave it hanging on the F for a beat. Space. Then return on the & of 2 with the same phrase: D, E♭, F, D. The note F is the resolution. It’s not just a melody — it’s a memory walking through the door.*

**Wayne Shorter leans forward.**

The room is still. The beat is there. The story has begun.
