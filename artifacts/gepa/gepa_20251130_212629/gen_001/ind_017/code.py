**Title: "Dark Light" – Intro (4 Bars in Fm)**  
**Key: Fm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM, 4/4 Time**  
**Length: 6 seconds total**  
**Mood: Intense, searching, alive**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on beat 1, snare on beat 3  
Hi-hat on all eighths  
*Very subtle, but aggressive. The tension is here before the melody.*

**Bar 2 – Everyone enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Fm7 chord  
Walking line:  
F – G♭ – G – A♭  
Chromatic approach to A♭  
Then F – G♭ – G – A♭ (chromatic again)  
*Every note different, every step a question.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on beat 2 and 4  
F7 (F A C E♭) on beat 2  
F7 again on beat 4  
*Dissonant but controlled, the push behind the melody.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3  
Snare on 2 and 4  
Hi-hat on all eighths  
*Driving forward, but not overwhelming.*

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
Start the motif.

**Melody (Tenor Sax):**  
F – G♭ (half note)  
Then a short, sharp phrase:  
A♭ – B♭ – C (trill-like, not a run)  
End on B♭, suspended  
*One short phrase — a question in the dark.*

**Bar 4 – Resolve (You, Marcus, Diane, Ray):**  
**You (Tenor):**  
Repeat the phrase, but with a slight variation:  
F – G♭ (half note)  
A♭ – B♭ – C (same as before)  
But this time, end on C  
*The light finds you.*

**Marcus:**  
Continues walking line  
F – G♭ – G – A♭ – A – B♭ – B – C  
*Still chromatic, still searching, but now with a direction.*

**Diane:**  
Same F7 comp on 2 and 4  
But now with a slight rubato on the last chord  
*She hears it now.*

**Little Ray:**  
Same pattern, but with a slight swell at the end  
*The room holds its breath.*

**Final Moment:**  
That last note on C — a single, sustained note — hangs in the air like a challenge.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
The Cellar is silent.  
The spark has caught.
