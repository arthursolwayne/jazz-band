---

**Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s):**  
**Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on beat 1 and 3. Snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on every eighth note, but *soft*.  
*Feel the tension. Let the space matter.*  
- Kick: 1, 3  
- Snare: 2, 4  
- Hihat: 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &  
- Cymbal crash on 4, just before the next bar.

---

**Bar 2 (1.5 - 3.0s):**  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Start the melody — a short, singing phrase.  
- Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb)  
- Play: F (long, open, soulful) → Bb (half note, bending slightly)  
- Let it hang on the Bb for a beat. Don’t resolve yet.  
- Let it breathe. Let it *ask* a question.

---

**Bar 3 (3.0 - 4.5s):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Walk Fm with roots and fifths, chromatic approach on the 3rd.  
- F → C → Gb → F (chromatic approach to Fm7)  
- Then walk: F → Ab → C → Eb (Fm7)  
- Keep it grounded. No rush. No show.

**Diane (Piano):**  
Play open voicings, one chord per bar.  
- Bar 2: Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb)  
- Bar 3: D♭7 (D♭, F, A♭, C) — resolving on the last beat to Fm  
- Comp on 2 and 4. Let the chords color the story, not dictate it.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick: 1  
- Snare: 2  
- Hihat: every eighth  
- Play a fill on beat 3, leading into the final bar.

---

**Bar 4 (4.5 - 6.0s):**  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Come back and finish the phrase.  
- Finish the Bb with a gentle, descending turn: Bb → A → G → F  
- End on F, sustained, clean, with a little breath.  
- Let it speak. Let it feel like the beginning of something new.  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- F → Ab → C → Eb (Fm7)  
- End on Eb, open, with a little rub on the last beat.  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb)  
- End on Eb, with a soft release.  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick: 1  
- Snare: 2  
- Hihat: every eighth  
- End with a soft cymbal swish on beat 4.

**Final Touch:**  
After the last note, silence.  
A beat of silence.  
Then the room breathes.  
And Wayne Shorter leans forward.

**That’s the intro.**  
It's not a question. It's a memory walking through the door.  
And it's only the beginning.
