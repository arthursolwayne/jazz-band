---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
A soft, deliberate intro.  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3.  
- Snare on beat 2 and 4, but with a *light* stick.  
- Hihat on every eighth note, but played with a subtle, rustling friction—like a dry brush.  
- A fill on beat 3: hi-hat and snare, tight and fast, like a breath held.

**Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line in Fm, starting on **F**, descending chromatically:  
  **F → Eb → D → C**  
- Then up chromatically: **C → Bb → B → C**  
- Chromatic approach to the 3rd (Ab), resolving to a **G** (chromatic passing tone) before landing on **F** to set up the next bar.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on the 2nd and 4th beats.  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - **2nd beat:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)  
  - **4th beat:** Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb)  
- She plays the chords with a slight delay, as if she’s reacting to you, not setting up.  
- The left hand has a walking bass line, but it's syncopated, a bit behind the beat, to create tension.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3 again.  
- Snare on 2 and 4, but this time with a sharp *snick*, like a match being struck.  
- Hihat continues on every eighth, but now with a bit more presence, still not overpowering.

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**

- Your motif:  
  - **F** (beat 1) — long, breathy, like a sigh.  
  - **Ab** (beat 2) — sharp, staccato, almost like a question.  
  - **C** (beat 3) — held, but with a slight vibrato, as if you're holding your breath.  
  - **F** (beat 4) — soft, almost not there.  
- The last note fades out, leaving a space.  
- Not a run, not a scale — just four notes with space between them.  
- The shape is: **F → Ab → C → F** — a simple, angular phrase with a strange resolution.

**Bar 4 – Full Band Repeats with Subtle Changes**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- The same walking line as before, but with a slight syncopation—play the **F** on the "and" of beat 1, then the **Eb** on beat 2.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- She uses the same chords, but now she leaves out the root on the 2nd beat, playing just **Ab, C, D** — a suspended sound.  
- On the 4th beat, she adds a **Cm7** with a **Bb** in the left hand, bending the harmony slightly.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3.  
- Snare on 2 and 4, but now with a *slap* on beat 4, a sudden, jarring sound.  
- Hihat continues, but now with a slight *swell* as the bar ends, like the room holding its breath.

**Final Note (from you):**  
You leave the last **F** hanging, just a whisper.  
It's not an ending — it's a question.  
And in the back of the room, Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He’s heard it before.  
But not like this.

**End of Intro.**  
Now, the real song begins.
