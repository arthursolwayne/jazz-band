Create a dynamic, cohesive quartet piece that breathes and evolves over two bars. Focus on balance, rhythm, and space.

**Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s):**  
Let the drums carry the energy. Use a full kit with rhythmic complexity and subtle syncopation. Build tension with layered patterns — kick on the downbeats, snare on the offbeats, and hihats with rhythmic variety. Let the groove breathe, but stay tight and alive.

**Bar 2 (1.5 - 3.0s):**  
Introduce the quartet with intention.  
- **Sax:** Play a short, melodic motif with space between notes. Let the silence mean something — don’t fill every moment. Let the rhythm of the bass and drums guide your phrasing.  
- **Bass:** Walk the changes with chromatic motion, avoiding repeated pitches. Syncopate when it feels right, stay in the pocket when it doesn’t. Be the heartbeat of the ensemble.  
- **Piano:** Comp with 7th chords but leave space for the melody. Use off-beats to add color, not to overpower. Let the rhythm section drive the groove.  
- **Drums:** Maintain the energy from Bar 1, but subtly shift or respond to the new melodic and harmonic content. Keep the groove anchored but alive.  

**Overall:**  
Balance density and space. Let the music breathe, but keep the energy moving. Every instrument has a role — don’t play against the others, play with them. Use silence and dynamics to create contrast and momentum.
