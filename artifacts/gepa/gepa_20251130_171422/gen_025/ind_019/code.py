**Prompt:**

Compose a 4-bar jazz intro in the key of D major at 160 BPM, 4/4 time, for a quartet — tenor sax, upright bass, piano, and drums. The intro must be subtle, emotionally charged, and full of tension and space. It must feel like the beginning of a story, not a sequence of notes.

- **Bar 1**: Drums only. Little Ray sets the mood with a sparse, punchy groove — kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth, but not all at once. Use dynamic variation — some hits are soft, some are sharp. The rhythm should be tight but not mechanical. It’s a heartbeat, not a metronome.
  
- **Bars 2–4**: Full ensemble. Tenor sax takes the lead with a short, emotionally resonant motif — one phrase, two or three notes, played with dynamic shading and space. Let it breathe, let it hang. Don’t rush it. It should feel like a question, a memory, or a whisper of something unfinished.

- **Bass**: Marcus plays a walking line, but it’s melodic and chromatic. Every note should have purpose. Use chromatic approaches, but never the same note twice. Let the line sing — it’s not just rhythm, it’s emotion. Shift dynamics subtly to match the mood.

- **Piano**: Diane comps with 7th chords, playing on beats 2 and 4, but with emotion, not just rhythm. Use silence, dynamics, and tension to shape the mood. Let the chords breathe — not all notes need to be played. Space is part of the story.

- **Drums**: Little Ray continues to fill the bar with hihat, kick, and snare, but with variation. Some bars have more energy, some have space. Use dynamic variation and tension to build the mood, not just fill the time.

- **Tenor Sax**: Make the motif concise, memorable, and emotionally resonant. No scale runs — that’s for students. Use rests, dynamics, and phrasing to make it feel like a breath, not a sequence. Let it be a question, a memory, or a challenge.

- **Overall**: The intro should feel like the moment before a story begins — the kind of moment that makes a legend lean forward. Wayne Shorter is in the audience. This is your shot. Make it count.
