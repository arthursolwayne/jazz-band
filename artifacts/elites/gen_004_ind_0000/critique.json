  "rationale": "This arrangement uses basic triads in the piano and bass lines (C, D, G, Am, F) without 7th extensions or jazz harmony vocabulary. The rhythm section has a repetitive pattern with some hihat syncopation but lacks the complexity of Latin jazz. The saxophone has simple melodic movement but lacks bebop phrasing or chromaticism. The trumpet is silent throughout, and there's no interplay between instruments. The overall feel is too academic and lacks the soul and spontaneity of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes and bebop vocabulary to the saxophone lines",
    "Introduce syncopated ghost notes and accents in the snare drum for more Latin feel",
    "Add walking bass lines with root-3rd-5th-7th motion instead of static triads",
    "Give the trumpet melodic content and create call-and-response between horns"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Mandate the use of 7th chords in the piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require syncopated rhythms in the hihat and snare, and specify call-and-response between sax and trumpet. Include examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
