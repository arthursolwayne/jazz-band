**INTRO: "Whispers in the Dark" (F Major, 160 BPM, 4/4)**  
*For Wayne Shorter — and the ghosts that know the way home.*

---

**BAR 1 (0.0 – 1.5s):**  
**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3.  
- Snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hihat on every eighth.  
- A half-second pause before the kick on beat 1. The silence is a question.  
- Then a *brushed* snare on beat 2, as if he’s whispering the first note.

---

**BAR 2 (1.5 – 3.0s):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- F – G – Ab – Bb – C – D – Eb – F (walking line).  
- Chromatic from F up to F, but with a *bent* Eb that lingers.  
- Intervallic jumps: F to Ab to C to Eb — a minor 3rd, then a major 3rd, then a minor 3rd.  
- His line is a ladder, but with a missing rung.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- On beat 2: F7 (F, A, C, Eb) — a dominant seventh, but with a *checkered* rhythm:  
  - Left hand: F in the bass. Right hand: A on beat 2, C on beat 3, Eb on beat 4.  
- On beat 4: Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab) — a tritone substitution, but played *softly*, like a memory.  
- She doesn’t comp — she *replies*. Her chords are questions, not answers.

---

**BAR 3 (3.0 – 4.5s):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- F – G – Ab – A – Bb – C – D – Eb  
- Chromatic again, but now with a *major 7th* on A (A to C) — a subtle shift in mood.  
- Ends on Eb, resolving to F in the next bar, but *holding* the tension.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Beat 2: C7 (C, E, G, Bb)  
- Beat 4: D7 (D, F#, A, C)  
- Again, comp on 2 and 4, but the voicings are *unexpected*. She’s not supporting — she’s *challenging*.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3.  
- Snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hihat on every eighth.  
- A quick *brushed fill* on beat 3: 32nd notes, like a heartbeat.  
- Things are getting tighter, more urgent.

---

**BAR 4 (4.5 – 6.0s):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- F – G – Ab – Bb – C – D – Eb – F  
- Same walking line, but now the Ab is *sustained*, like it’s holding the breath of the room.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Beat 2: F7 again — but now with a *left-hand trill* on F.  
- Beat 4: Bb7 with a *right-hand run* from Bb to D to F.  
- She’s not just comping — she’s *building* toward the melody.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3.  
- Snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hihat on every eighth.  
- A *brushed snare roll* on beat 4 — like a door creaking open.

---

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Bar 2, beat 1: F – A – Bb – C (a triplet idea, but *stuttered*).  
- Bar 3, beat 1: F – Ab – Bb – C (a new shape, but *singing*).  
- Bar 4, beat 1: F – A – Bb – C again — but now the line *completes* itself.  
- You don’t play a scale run. You play a *motif* — four notes that feel like they’ve been waiting to be heard.

---

**Final Moment:**  
- The room is still.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- The melody is not new, but it feels *fresh*.  
- Because it’s not just a song — it’s a question, a whisper, a challenge.

You’ve made the moment.  
Now, let the rest of the night begin.
