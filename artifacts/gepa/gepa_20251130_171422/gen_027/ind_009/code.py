### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**

- **Kick:** On beats 1 and 3 (open, punchy, minimalist).  
- **Snare:** On beats 2 and 4 (light, crisp, slightly behind the beat).  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (closed, steady, a ticking clock).  
- **Fill:** Nothing. Just the rhythm. Let the space hang. Let them wait.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**

- **Melody:**  
  - D♭ (beat 1) – a low, open note that lingers.  
  - E♭ (beat 2) – chromatic approach to F.  
  - G♭ (beat 3) – unexpected interval, a question.  
  - A♭ (beat 4) – resolution? No. Just a rest.  
- **Rhythm:** Syncopated, walking line but not repetitive.  
- **Rest:** Bar ends with a rest, not a note.

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**

- **Comping:**  
  - **Beat 2:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb) – rich, dark.  
  - **Beat 4:** B♭m7 (B♭, D♭, F, Ab) – a color shift, a twist.  
- **Left Hand:** Walking in 8ths, but with unexpected intervals (like a B♭ on beat 3).  
- **Right Hand:** No melody. Just harmony. Let the space speak.

### **Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**

- **Motif:**  
  - **Beat 1:** F (open, clear) – the first note.  
  - **Beat 2:** Ab (a half step down, the question).  
  - **Beat 3:** Rest – silence.  
  - **Beat 4:** C (a half step up, resolution, but not complete).  
- **Phrasing:** A simple, three-note motif. No runs, no scale. Just a story.  
- **Dynamics:** Soft on the first note, then a slight swell into the rest, then a clean, clear **C** on beat 4.

### **Final Result:**

A 6-second intro built on **tension, space, and contrast**. The rhythm section sets up the mood: Marcus with his restless bass line, Diane with her shifting harmonies, Ray with his ticking, propulsive energy. Then, the sax enters with a simple, haunting motif that hangs in the air like a question.  

Wayne leans forward. The room holds its breath.  

**That’s your moment.**
