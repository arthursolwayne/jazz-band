### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Mood: Tension, anticipation, silence as a player.**  
- **Kick:** On beat 1 only — a deep, resonant hit that echoes in the room.  
- **Snare:** On beat 3 — a sharp, dry snap.  
- **Hi-hat:** Subtle, barely there, on the & of 1 and 3 — like a whisper.  
- **Space:** The rest of the bar is empty. No cymbals, no fills.  
- **Why?** It’s the silence that makes the heart beat. Wayne leans in.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters (Marcus, Diane, Dante)**  
**Introduce the motif: The question.**  
- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - Dm7 chord on beat 1 (D, F, Ab, C)  
  - Chromatic walk down: C, B, A, G, F  
  - Ends on G on beat 4 — unresolved, hanging.  
- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - 7th chords: Dm7 on beat 1  
  - Dm7 on beat 2 (left hand: D, F, Ab, C)  
  - Right hand: melodic line, descending from F to Eb — sharp, angry, emotional.  
- **Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
  - Play a short, angular motif:  
    - **D - Eb - F - G** (ascending, with a slight bend on the G)  
    - Hold the G for a full beat, then release it into silence.  
    - *That’s the question. What happens next?*

### **Bar 3 – Development**  
**The story begins to unfold.**  
- **Marcus:**  
  - Chromatic walk up from G: G, A, Bb, B, C  
  - Ends on C on beat 4 — still unresolved.  
- **Diane:**  
  - Dm7 on beat 1 again, but now with a diminished chord on beat 3 — F7b9 (F, A, C, Eb, Gb)  
  - Emotion builds — anger, tension, a story told in chords.  
- **Dante:**  
  - Repeat the motif but shift it up a half-step:  
    - **Eb - F - G - Ab**  
    - Hold the Ab, let it hang.  
    - *This is not a question anymore — it’s a challenge.*

### **Bar 4 – Resolution or Open Ending**  
**The moment that could change everything.**  
- **Marcus:**  
  - Chromatic walk down from C: C, B, A, G, F  
  - Ends on F on beat 4 — a half-step below the root.  
- **Diane:**  
  - Dm7 on beat 1 again, but now with a quick, dissonant chord on beat 2 (G7#9)  
  - She doesn’t resolve — she *invites* resolution.  
- **Dante:**  
  - Play the motif again, but now with a slight **turn** on the final note:  
    - **D - Eb - F - G**  
    - Instead of holding the G, do a half-step turn: G to Ab to G.  
    - Let the note fade out.  
    - The silence after that note is the only thing that matters.

**Final beat (end of Bar 4):**  
- Little Ray plays a soft, open hi-hat on the & of 4 — like a breath.  
- The room holds.  
- Wayne Shorter nods.  
- You’ve said something.  
- And it’s yours.

**That’s the intro.**  
Now the story begins.
