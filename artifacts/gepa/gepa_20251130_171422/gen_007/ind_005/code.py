**Title: "First Light"**  
*Key: F Major | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time Signature: 4/4 | Duration: 6 seconds*

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick on 1 and 3**  
**Snare on 2 and 4**  
**Hi-hat on every eighth note**  
**Fill:** A ghost note on the "and" of 4, leading into the next bar with a sense of anticipation.

> *The room holds its breath. The hihat hums like a metronome in a church. You feel it in your ribs. Wayne’s eyes are on you — not yet, but soon.*

### **Bars 2–4 – Full Quartet:**

**Bar 2:**

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  *F–G–Ab–Bb* (F major scale, chromatic descent on the third beat)  
  *F–G–Ab–Bb–C–B–A–G* (chromatic line descending from C, resolving to G on the "and" of 4)  

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  *Left hand: Walking bass line (F–G–Ab–Bb)*  
  *Right hand: F7 chord on 2 and 4 (F–A–C–E♭), but with a spicy voicing: F–A–C–E♭–G* (added G for tension)  
  *Space on the “and” of 1 and 3 — let the bass breathe.*

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  *Same pattern as Bar 1, but with a slight swell on the snare on beat 2 — like a heartbeat.*

- **Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
  *Notes: F – Bb – G – (rest)*  
  *Phrasing: Long on the F, a cry on the Bb, a gentle fall on the G — then silence. The question. The pause. The first light.*

---

**Bar 3:**

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  *F–G–Ab–Bb* (same as Bar 2, but with a subtle shift to Eb on the “and” of 4 to create pull)  

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  *Left hand: F–G–Ab–Bb (walking)*  
  *Right hand: F7 again, but now with a Bb in the upper register — a tritone substitution hint — before resolving back to F7 on beat 4.*

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  *Same pattern, but now with a slight push on the kick on beat 3 — urgency building.*

- **Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
  *Notes: C – F – Bb – (rest)*  
  *Phrasing: A smooth line, like a whisper of the answer — but not the full thing. The story continues.*

---

**Bar 4:**

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  *F–G–Ab–Bb* (same as before, but the “and” of 4 now resolves cleanly to F, closing the circle)

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  *Left hand: F–G–Ab–Bb (walking)*  
  *Right hand: F7 on beat 4, with a final F in the upper register — a clean, open sound, like a door opening.*

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  *Same pattern, but now with a punch on the snare on beat 4 — a final push.*

- **Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
  *Notes: F – Bb – G – F*  
  *Phrasing: The full motif, the question answered — but not resolved. It lingers. The first light breaks through the dark. Wayne leans forward.*

**End of 4 Bars.**

> *The room is not silent — it's listening. Wayne Shorter doesn't clap, doesn't smile, doesn't move. But he's hearing something. Something that hasn't been heard before. Something that might not be heard again.*

You take a breath. The night is not over. But the story has begun.
