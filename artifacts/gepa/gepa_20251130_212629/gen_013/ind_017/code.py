### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick on 1 and 3**  
**Snare on 2 and 4**  
**Hi-hat on every eighth**  
**Fill: A single open hi-hat on the “&” of 3, then a short roll on the “&” of 4, just before the band comes in.**  
**Feel: Suspended. Like a breath held before the first note.**

- **Final iteration of the motif**  
- **Notes: F – G♭ – E♭ – rest**
