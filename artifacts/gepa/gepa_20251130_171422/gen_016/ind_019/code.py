**Title: "Whispers in the Cellar"**  
*Key: F Major | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time Signature: 4/4 | Duration: 6.0 seconds*

---

### **Bar 1 (0.0–1.5 seconds): Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick on 1 and 3** – soft, with a slight delay on the *3* to create a subtle tension.  
**Snare on 2 and 4** – crisp, but not aggressive.  
**Hi-hat on every eighth** – light and open, with a small *space* between the 4th and 1st beat.  
*Let the room hold the silence between the snare and the kick on beat 4.*

### **Bar 2 (1.5–3.0 seconds): Marcus (Bass) enters**  
**Walking line in F major** –  
**F – G – A♭ – B♭ – B – A – G – F**  
*Chromatic approach on the B♭ (from A) and a bent note on the A to B to create a sense of yearning.*  
**Diatonic resolution on the F** – but played with a slight rub against the beat (a quarter note on the “and” of 4).  
*He’s the anchor, but his melody is a question, not an answer.*

### **Bar 3 (3.0–4.5 seconds): Diane (Piano) enters**  
**Comp on 2 and 4** –  
**Bar 2: F7 (F A C E)**  
**Bar 3: B♭7 (B♭ D F A)**  
*She plays the chords with a slight dissonance on the 2nd beat of bar 3 — a G♭ in the left hand against the B♭7. It's a whisper of a tritone substitution, but not resolved.*  
*The space between the chords is where the story lives.*

### **Bar 4 (4.5–6.0 seconds): Dante (Tenor Sax) enters with the motif**  
**Motif:**  
**F – G – A♭ – F (G – A♭ – B♭ – A♭)**  
*Simple, but with a twist: a half-step resolution on the A♭, then a *rest* on the last beat of the bar.*  
*You play it with a breath, not a note — like a memory surfacing, not a statement being made.*  
*End with a soft, fading F on the 4th beat — but not resolved. Let it hover.*

---

### **Final Result:**  
A slow-burn intro that feels like a question in the dark — not a resolution, not an answer, but a moment that makes the room lean in. Wayne Shorter, in the back, lifts his glass.  
*You just gave him something to think about.*
