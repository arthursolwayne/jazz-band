**Title: "First Light"**

**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 4 bars (6.0 seconds)**  

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
*Let the silence before the first note hang. Let the room breathe. The audience isn't just waiting — they're listening.*

**Bar 2 – Everyone Joins In**  
Marcus (Bass):  
F – G – Ab – Bb – C – B – A – G  
*Walking line, chromatic descent from C to G, with a moment of tension on the Bb before resolving.*

Diane (Piano):  
F7 on beat 2, A7 on beat 4  
*Comp with space. The chords are there, but they're not crowding the air. She knows when to hold back.*

Little Ray (Drums):  
Same pattern as Bar 1, but with a subtle fill on the snare before beat 4 — a whisper of energy building.

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
Motif:  
F – G – Eb – F  
*Short, expressive, a question in the air. The first note is a breath, the second a step forward, the third a hesitation, the fourth a return. It’s not a scale run — it’s a thought, a memory. You leave it hanging on the Eb, like a door slightly ajar.*

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
Motif (continued):  
F – D – F  
*You come back, but not the same way. The D is a step back — a moment of clarity, a glimpse of something deeper. Then you close it with a clean F, resolving the tension but not the mystery.*

Marcus (Bass):  
F – G – Ab – Bb – C – B – A – F  
*He’s still walking, but now he’s answering the question you just asked with his own voice.*

Diane (Piano):  
F7 on beat 2, Bb7 on beat 4  
*She keeps it moving, but now the chords have a little more color, a little more heat.*

Little Ray (Drums):  
Same pattern, but now with a slightly more aggressive kick on beat 3 — a heartbeat, a pulse that’s building.

**Final Note:**  
You end on F, clean and clear.  
No applause yet.  
But Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He’s heard it.  
He’s listening.

That’s all it takes.
