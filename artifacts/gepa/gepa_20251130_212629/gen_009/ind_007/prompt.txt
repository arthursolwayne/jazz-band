You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

**Timing:** 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

**Arrangement:**
- **Bar 1:** Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait.
- **Bars 2–4:** Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before.

**Composition Rules:**
- **Marcus (bass):** Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He's the anchor.
- **Diane (piano):** 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving.
- **Little Ray (drums):** Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar.
- **You (tenor):** This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit.

**Mood and Intent:**
- Create a sense of movement and emotional tension — like a door opening just enough to hint at something deeper.
- Let the rhythm be tight, the harmony rich, and the melody haunting.
- Don’t be afraid to leave space, but don’t let it feel empty. The goal is to make Wayne lean in and listen closely.

**Specific Guidance:**
- Use **rests and varied note durations** to shape the feeling of anticipation and release.
- Let the **drums open the space**, then let the **bass anchor the rhythm**, the **piano color the mood**, and the **saxophone tell the story**.
- The melody should feel **incomplete at first**, like it’s searching for something — and then **resolve with clarity and purpose**.

**Goal:**
Make the first four bars feel like the beginning of something real — not just a setup, but a doorway.
