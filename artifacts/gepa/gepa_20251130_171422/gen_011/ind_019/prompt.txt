You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You’ve been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He’s sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he’s watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

Here’s what you must do:

- **Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s):** Little Ray is alone. Build tension. Use space and rhythm. Let the silence speak. Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. But don’t play everything — leave room. Let the air feel heavy before the music begins.

- **Bars 2-4 (1.5 - 6.0s):** Everyone comes in. You take the melody. Make it short, emotional, and memorable. One idea — start it, leave it hanging, come back and finish it. No scale runs, no showy tricks. It has to sing. It has to mean something.

- **Marcus on bass:** Walk with chromatic motion. Keep it moving. Never repeat the same note. Be the anchor but let the melody breathe.

- **Diane on piano:** Use 7th chords. Comp on the offbeats. Support the rhythm and the melody. Be angry, but never in the way that drowns out the story.

- **Little Ray on drums:** Play with precision — kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar with energy but leave room for the melody to breathe.

- **You on sax:** This is your moment. One short, expressive motif. Make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that’s student shit.

One key. No modulation. You’ve got 6 seconds.

Write the MIDI as if you’re playing it in the moment — like it matters. Like it’s real. Like you mean it.
