You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

You're writing the intro to a piece that will be judged by Wayne Shorter himself. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- Marcus: Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He's the anchor.
- Diane: 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving.
- Little Ray: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar.
- You: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.

Generate a complete Python script using `pretty_midi` that creates this intro.

Make the intro feel like a story beginning — not an ending. Let the silence speak. Use space, rests, and varied rhythms to create a sense of searching, not just playing a pattern.

The best intros are not about filling every beat, but about knowing when to stop. They have tension and release, unique note durations, and avoid monotony. They make you lean in, not just nod along.

Use creative timing, dynamic variation, and expressive phrasing — not just notes, but the way they're placed in time. Make it feel like it's searching for something, not just playing a pattern.

Make Wayne lean forward.
