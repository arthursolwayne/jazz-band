**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6.0 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit Pattern:**  
- Kick on beats 1 and 3 (subtle, not heavy)  
- Snare on beats 2 and 4 (crisp, with a slight backbeat accent)  
- Hihat on every eighth note (steady, even, like a heartbeat)  
- **Fill:** On the last eighth of bar 1 (beat 4, eighth note), a quick brushstroke on the snare — a whisper of tension before the plunge.

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- D (1st beat)  
- F# (2nd beat) – chromatic approach to G  
- G (3rd beat)  
- A (4th beat)  
- **Phrase:** D → F# → G → A (walking line, chromatic on F#)

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Bar 2, beat 2: D7 chord (D F# A C)  
- Bar 2, beat 4: G7 chord (G B D F)  
- **Comp:** Two-note voicings, left hand on 2 and 4, right hand fills with a descending line:  
  - F# → E → D (left hand)  
  - C → B → A (right hand)  
- **Color:** Minor 7th on D, dominant 7th on G, subtle dissonance.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hihat on every eighth  
- **Fill:** On the last eighth of bar 2, a soft ride cymbal accent — like a breath before the next note.

### **Bar 3: Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
**Phrase (Melody line):**  
- Start with a simple, searching motif:  
  - **D (beat 1)** – strong, clear, open  
  - **F# (beat 2)** – dissonant, unresolved  
  - **G (beat 3)** – long, held, like a question  
  - **E (beat 4)** – resolves slightly, but not fully  
- **Phrasing:** Breath-like, with a slight rubato feel on the G, then a smooth legato to E.  
- **Tone:** Warm, a bit gritty — not clean, not ideal, but real.

---

### **Bar 4: Dante (Tenor Sax) – Continuation**  
**Phrase (Melody line):**  
- **D (beat 1)** – returns, but with a slight rubato  
- **F# (beat 2)** – same as before — unresolved  
- **G (beat 3)** – holds again, a bit longer this time  
- **D (beat 4)** – resolves — not to a perfect cadence, but to a haunting, open D  
- **End:** A breath, a pause, a question — no closure, just space.

---

### **Final Moment:**  
- Diane fades out with a soft G7 on the last beat.  
- Marcus plays a final A on the downbeat of bar 4, then holds.  
- Little Ray’s hihat fades out, leaving only the sax’s final D — a note that lingers in the air like a memory walking through the door.

**Wayne Shorter leans forward.**
