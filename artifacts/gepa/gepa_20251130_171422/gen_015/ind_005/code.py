**Intro – "Whispers in the Cellar"**  
*Key: F Major | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time Signature: 4/4 | Duration: 6.0 seconds*

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Felt like a heartbeat in the dark.*  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3  
- Snare on beat 2 and 4  
- Hi-hats on every eighth note, light and fast  
- No cymbal crash, just the pulse of something waiting to erupt

---

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, chromatic and tense.*  
- F – Gb – G – Ab – A – Bb – B – C – D – Eb – E – F  
- Starts on beat 2, ends on beat 4  
- No repetition – each note a question

---

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*7th chords, comp on beats 2 and 4.*  
- Bar 2:  
  - Beat 2: F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
  - Beat 4: A7 (A, C#, E, G)  
  - Underneath, a dissonant left hand: Bb in the bass, E in the right  
  - Play it sharp, like she’s annoyed with the whole world

---

**Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Same pattern, but now with a subtle snare roll on beat 3 – a warning.*

---

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Your motif.*  
- F – Gb – F – rest  
- Then: A – Bb – A – rest  
- Silence is your friend. The space is the question.

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
- F – Gb – A – Bb  
- End on Bb, hold it, don’t resolve  
- Let the note hang like a thought in the back of your mind  
- No scale run, just a whisper of something new

---

**Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass):**  
- Ends on A (just before the Bb) – a chromatic lead-in  
- Plays A, then a half-step up to Bb, then stops  
- Leaves it unresolved, like the bass is holding its breath

---

**Bar 4 – Diane (Piano):**  
- Last chord: Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
- Left hand plays a dissonant G in the bass  
- A challenge, not an answer

---

**Bar 4 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hats on every eighth  
- But ends with a sudden drop – the sound dies, and the room holds its breath

---

**That’s the intro.**  
It’s not a statement. It’s a question.  
It’s not a melody. It’s a thought.  
It’s not a solo. It’s a challenge.  

And in the back of the room,  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He’s listening.  
He’s smiling.  
He’s ready.
