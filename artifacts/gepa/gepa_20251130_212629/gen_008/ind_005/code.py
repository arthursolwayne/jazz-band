*Rest. Space. Tension.*

- **Kick:** Open on beat 1.  
- **Snare:** Ghost on beat 3.  
- **Hi-hat:** Off-beats, but sparse — just the 8th note on 3 and 7.  
- **Cymbal:** A soft crash on the 3rd beat, like a door creaking.  
- **Fill:** Nothing. Just the breath of the room.

*Let the space speak. Let the audience remember what silence feels like.*

- Comp on beats 2 and 4.  
- **Beat 2:** Dm7 (D-F-A-C)  
- **Beat 4:** Dm7♭5 (D-F-A♭-C) — a twist, a memory, a doubt.  
- **Left hand:** Walking bass line, chromatic movement.

**BAR 3: Dante on Tenor Sax — Melody Begins**

*Your motif: A short, haunting phrase, not a scale, but a moment.*

- **Beat 1:** D (low, long, soft)  
- **Beat 2:** F (high, sharp, like a whisper)  
- **Beat 3:** Eb (rest, space, breath)  
- **Beat 4:** Rest — leave it hanging.

*Let the silence speak. Let the room hold the question.*

**BAR 4: Dante on Tenor Sax — Resolution (or not)**

- **Beat 1:** D (same as before, but higher, stronger)  
- **Beat 2:** F (same note, but with a slight bend, like a memory)  
- **Beat 3:** Eb (same as before, but with a little more weight, like a truth)  
- **Beat 4:** C (resolve, but not fully — a half-step down, a question still in the air)

*End not on a stable note, but on something that makes the room lean in.*

**Marcus on Bass:**  
- **Beat 1:** C (b9)  
- **Beat 2:** D (root)  
- **Beat 3:** F (7th)

- **Beat 2:** Dm7  
- **Beat 4:** Dm7♭5  
- **Right hand:** A single, unresolved chord — a moment caught in time.

**Little Ray on Drums:**  
- **Kick:** 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** 8th notes, tighter, more focused.  
- **Cymbal:** Final splash on beat 4 — a flicker of a flame.

**Final Note:**  
You don’t finish the melody. You leave it open — just enough to make Wayne lean forward, to make the whole room feel like it’s on the edge of something real. Not a resolution, but a beginning.

*That’s your shot.*
