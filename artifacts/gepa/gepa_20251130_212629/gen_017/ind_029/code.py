**Intro – 4-bar jazz piece in Fm at 160 BPM**

**Bar 1 – Rhythm Section (Little Ray on Drums):**  
- **Kick:** On beat 1, with a firm, low pulse.  
- **Snare:** On beat 3, crisp and dry, with a slight backbeat edge.  
- **Hi-hats:** Tight, descending on each 16th note, starting on the “&” of 1, landing on the “&” of 4.  
- **Feel:** Urgent, but controlled — like a heartbeat counting down to something.

**Bar 2 – Melody (Wayne on Horn):**  
- A single, clear motif: **Fm7** scale — **F, Gb, Ab, Bb** — played in a slow, spaced-out triplet rhythm.  
- **Phrase:**  
  - Beat 1: **F**  
  - Beat 2: **Gb**  
  - Beat 3: **Ab**  
  - Beat 4: **Bb**  
- Let the note **F** hang on beat 1, then **Gb** on beat 2. Give each note just enough time to breathe — the silence between them is as important as the note itself.

**Bar 3 – Rhythm Section (Bass & Piano):**  
- **Bass (walking line):** Chromatic descent from **Bb** to **F**, outlining the **Fm7** chord. No repetition.  
  - **Bb → A → G → F**  
- **Piano (Diane):**  
  - On **beat 2**: **F7** (F, A, C, Eb)  
  - On **beat 4**: **Fm7** (F, Ab, C, Eb)  
  - Chords are played as **voicings** — not block chords — with space between notes, leaving room for the melody to breathe.  
  - The piano is sharp, slightly dissonant, urgent — like a whisper of anger.

**Bar 4 – Melody (Wayne):**  
- Repeat the motif, but with a slight variation — **F, Gb, Ab, Bb** — played a half-step lower in pitch (i.e., in **Eb**), creating a **chromatic descent**.  
- The last note, **Bb**, lingers a little longer — a moment of tension before the next phrase.  
- The rhythm section holds the same groove, steady and grounded, supporting the moment without pushing it forward.

**Final Feel:**  
This is not a loud intro — it's a *clear* one. It’s built on the space between the notes, the tension of the bass walking down, the urgency of Diane’s piano, and the way Wayne’s melody sings against it. It’s a moment that makes Wayne lean forward, not because it’s loud — but because it’s *precise*, and it *means something*.
