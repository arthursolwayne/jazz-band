### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums) – "The Wait"**  
- **Kick drum:** On beats 1 and 3 (deep, resonant, low).  
- **Snare:** On beats 2 and 4 (crisp, dry).  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (tight, steady, like a heartbeat).  
- **Fill:** At the end of the bar — a quick triple stroke on the snare, then a roll into silence.  
- **Dynamics:** Begins soft, building to a whisper of tension before the silence.  
- **Purpose:** A sense of anticipation. The room holds its breath. Wayne leans forward.

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters – "The First Breath"**  
- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D♭) – walking line, chromatic approach on the 3rd beat.  
  - Notes: F – G♭ – Ab – B♭ – C – D♭ – Eb – F  
  - Dynamics: Sustain each note slightly, let the bass line have a "weight" to it.  

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - Comp on beat 2 and 4.  
  - Chords:  
    - Beat 2: Cm7 (C, Eb, G, B♭)  
    - Beat 4: Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D♭)  
  - Use a sharp attack, but space between chords. Let the piano breathe.  

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  - Keen on beat 1, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every 8th.  
  - Subtle cymbal swells on the off-beats.

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax) – "The Question"**  
- **Melody (Fm):**  
  - Notes: F – G♭ – Ab – B♭ (rest) – F – G♭ – Ab – D♭ (rest)  
  - Dynamics: Start soft, let the first note ring, then a pause. Then repeat the phrase, a bit louder.  
  - Tone: Smooth, smoky, but with tension. It’s not a cry — it's a whisper with purpose.  
  - Phrase: “F – G♭ – Ab – B♭” is the motif.  
  - Let the last note (B♭) hang. Silence is part of the story.

### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) – "The Answer"**  
- **Melody (Fm):**  
  - Notes: F – G♭ – Ab – D♭ (rest) – F – G♭ – Ab – B♭ (rest)  
  - Dynamics: Slightly louder than bar 3, but still controlled.  
  - Phrase: Repeat the motif, but end with a B♭, resolving the tension.  
  - Let the last note fall gently into silence.  

- **Ensemble:**  
  - Marcus continues the walking line, Diane plays the Fm7 chord on beat 4.  
  - Little Ray plays a soft roll on the snare, then fades out.

### **Final Note (Silence):**  
- A full second of silence after the last note.  
- The room is still.  
- Wayne Shorter nods.  
- The story has begun.

**Story:** A quiet, emotional question. A moment that lingers. A beginning not just for the song, but for something more.
