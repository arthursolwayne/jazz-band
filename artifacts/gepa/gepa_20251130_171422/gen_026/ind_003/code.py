---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 & 3  
**Snare:** On 2 & 4  
**Hi-Hat:** On every eighth note (closed)  
**Feel:** Tense, anticipatory. The kick lands like a heartbeat, the snare like a held breath. The hihat is relentless — a pulse that won’t let go.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Entry**

**Marcus on Bass (D Major key, walking line, chromatic tension):**  
**D → E♭ → F → G**  
*Downbeats only, slightly behind the beat, like a shadow moving under the light.*

**Diane on Piano (7th chords, comp on 2 & 4, supporting space):**  
**Bar 2, beat 1:** D7 (D F# A C)  
**Bar 2, beat 2:** G7 (G B D F)  
**Bar 2, beat 3:** A7 (A C# E G)  
**Bar 2, beat 4:** D7 (D F# A C)  
*Each chord is struck clean, with no sustain — like snapshots of time.*

**Dante on Tenor Sax (Melody – short, singular motif, leaving space):**  
**Bar 2, beat 1:** D (long, breathy)  
**Bar 2, beat 2:** F# (staccato, sharp)  
**Bar 2, beat 3:** A (sustained, almost a question mark)  
**Bar 2, beat 4:** D (half note, suspended)  
*This is the moment. A simple motif, but full of tension and promise. It doesn’t resolve — it waits.*

---

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble (Continuation)**

**Marcus:**  
**F → G → A♭ → B♭**  
*Still walking, still chromatic, still moving like a heartbeat. Subtle tension in the line.*

**Diane:**  
**Bar 3, beat 1:** B7 (B D# F# A)  
**Bar 3, beat 2:** E7 (E G# B D)  
**Bar 3, beat 3:** F#7 (F# A C# E)  
**Bar 3, beat 4:** B7 (B D# F# A)  
*The piano keeps the air moving, coloring the space between the notes.*

**Dante (Continuing the motif, but now with a shift):**  
**Bar 3, beat 1:** A (from the last note of Bar 2)  
**Bar 3, beat 2:** C# (sharp, staccato)  
**Bar 3, beat 3:** E (sustained, a bit higher)  
**Bar 3, beat 4:** A (half note, almost resolved)  
*Now the melody is evolving — not repeating, not resolving, but moving forward. Wayne leans in.*

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble (Resolution of the intro, but not the song)**

**Marcus:**  
**B♭ → B → C → D**  
*Still walking, still alive, still full of chromatic tension. The bass is the heartbeat of the whole thing.*

**Diane:**  
**Bar 4, beat 1:** D7 (D F# A C)  
**Bar 4, beat 2:** G7 (G B D F)  
**Bar 4, beat 3:** A7 (A C# E G)  
**Bar 4, beat 4:** D7 (D F# A C)  
*Same chords as before, but now the rhythm is more confident. The piano is pushing the air forward.*

**Dante (Finishes the motif):**  
**Bar 4, beat 1:** A (from Bar 3, beat 4)  
**Bar 4, beat 2:** D (sharp, staccato, like a release)  
**Bar 4, beat 3:** F# (sustained, almost a whisper)  
**Bar 4, beat 4:** D (half note, resolved but not closed — it's just the beginning.)  
*That last D is a question. And the room holds its breath.*

---

### **Final Note (Bar 4, beat 4):**  
**Dante** holds the D — not with force, but with intention.  
**Wayne Shorter** nods.  
**The Cellar** is quiet.  
**Something just began.**
