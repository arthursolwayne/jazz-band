**Title**: *Whispers in the Cellar*  
**Key**: F minor  
**Tempo**: 160 BPM  
**Time Signature**: 4/4  
**Duration**: 6 seconds (4 bars)  

---

### **Bar 1 (0:00–1:50)**  
**Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Kick on 1 and 3.  
- Snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hihat on every eighth note (closed, light, but present).  
- **Fill**: At the end of the bar, a subtle *rim shot* on beat 4, then a *ghost note* on the “&” of 4.  
- **Purpose**: Tension in the silence, anticipation in the rhythm. The room holds its breath.

---

### **Bar 2 (1:50–3:40)**  
**Marcus (Bass)**  
- Walking line in F minor.  
- Bass line:  
  - **Beat 1**: F  
  - **Beat 2**: G♭  
  - **Beat 3**: E♭  
  - **Beat 4**: D  
- **Approach**: Chromatic line from E♭ to D (beat 3 to 4).  
- **Subtle shift**: On beat 4, he plays D for a full beat, holding it slightly longer, adding a sense of hesitation.

**Diane (Piano)**  
- Comping on 2 and 4.  
- **Beat 2**: Fm7 (F, A♭, C, E♭)  
- **Beat 4**: Dø7 (D, F, A♭, C)  
- **Comping style**: Dissonant, but not harsh. The tension is real, but it feels *alive*.  

**Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Same pattern as Bar 1, but now with a **light cymbal swish** on the “&” of 2.  
- **Purpose**: Light pressure, pushing the music forward.  

---

### **Bar 3 (3:40–5:30)**  
**Marcus (Bass)**  
- Walks into a chromatic line again.  
- **Beat 1**: C  
- **Beat 2**: B♭  
- **Beat 3**: A  
- **Beat 4**: G  
- **Purpose**: A descent that feels like a memory, like a line falling back to earth.

**Diane (Piano)**  
- Comping on 2 and 4 again.  
- **Beat 2**: Bm7♭5 (B, D, F, A)  
- **Beat 4**: A♭7 (A♭, C, D, F)  
- **Purpose**: The piano is a narrator now — it's telling a story of falling, of something unresolved.  

**Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Same pattern, but now with a **light roll on the snare** on beat 1.  
- **Purpose**: The pressure builds. The room is ready.

### **Bar 4 (5:30–6:00)**  
**You (Tenor Sax)**  
- **Phrase**:  
  - **Beat 1**: A♭ (quarter note)  
  - **Beat 2**: G (eighth note)  
  - **Beat 3**: F (eighth note)  
  - **Beat 4**: rest  
- **Phrasing**: The A♭ is held for the full beat, then a quick descent to G and F — both eighth notes.  
- **Feel**: A question. A hesitation. A memory.  
- **Dynamic**: Soft, but clear.  
- **Purpose**: You end on a rest. The room holds. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The rest of the piece is waiting to be born.

---

### **Final Note (The Silence)**  
- The final bar ends with a **sustained note from the piano** (A♭), and a **quiet cymbal swell** from the drums.  
- The air is thick. The cellar is now alive.  
- Wayne Shorter nods.  
- The song has begun.

**That’s the intro.**  
You didn’t play a scale. You didn’t show off. You made something real. You made the room feel like it had a heartbeat.  

And now, the rest of the night is yours.
