**"The Door" — 4-Bar Intro in Dm (D minor), 160 BPM, 4/4 Time**

---

**Bar 1 (0.0 – 1.5s):**  
**Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Kick on beats 1 and 3 (snare on 2 and 4)  
- Hihat on every eighth note  
- **Fill on beat 3:** A short ride cymbal swish, then back to hihat  
- **Rhythmic contrast:** The first bar is tight, but with a **lighter touch** on the hihat — almost like a soft breath. Ends with a **rest** on beat 4.  
- *Feeling:* Anticipation, like a door creaking open.

**Marcus (Bass)**  
- Walking line: Dm7 (D F A C)

**Diane (Piano)**  
- Comp on 2 and 4:  
  - **Beat 2:** Dm7 (D F A C)

    - 1/8 note: F#  
    - 1/16 note: G  
    - **Rest on beat 4**  
- **Phrasing:** D – F# – G – (rest)

**Bar 4 (4.5 – 6.0s):**  
**You (Tenor Sax)**  
- **Motif returns, but incomplete:**  
  - **Notes:** D – F# – G – (rest)  
  - **But this time, it stops at the rest** — **no resolution**  
- **Phrasing:** Same as before, but with **even more space** after the last note  
- **Dynamics:** Sustained on the last note, then a **sudden drop** to silence  
- **Feeling:** It feels like the **door is open**, but we don’t know what’s on the other side

**Marcus (Bass)**  
- **Line:** A – Bb – C – D  
- **Chromatic approach** to C (Bb to C)  
- **Ends on a D**, resolving to the tonic, but **not quite**

**Diane (Piano)**  
- Comp:  
  - **Beat 2:** Dm7  
  - **Beat 4:** Dm7/9  
- **Left hand:** Same walking line  
- **Right hand:** A **chordal flourish** on the last beat — a **diminished 7th chord** (F# diminished)  
- **Feeling:** Dissonance, tension, but not wrong

**Little Ray (Drums)**  
- **Beat 3:** A **long, sustained hihat** with a **crash cymbal** on beat 4  
- **Ends with a rest** — **no final hit**

---

**End of Intro (6.0s):**  
- Silence.  
- The room holds its breath.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.
