**Title: "Doorway in D"**  
*Key: D minor | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time Signature: 4/4*  
*For the first four bars of a new piece — a doorway to something real.*

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** 1, 3  
**Snare:** 2, 4  
**Hi-hats:** On every 8th note  
**Fill:** At the end of the bar, a ghost note or two on the snare to build tension.

> *Let the silence breathe first. Let the room wait. Let Wayne feel it.*

---

### **Bar 2: Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line (D minor)**  
**Notes (in D minor):**  
D – Eb – F – G – A – Bb – C – D  
**Chromatic approaches:**  
- D → Eb (chromatic approach to D)  
- F → G (chromatic approach to G)  
- Bb → C (chromatic approach to C)  
**Rhythm:** Walking 8th notes, driving the pulse.

> *Marcus is the anchor, not the leader. He’s there, but he’s not shouting. Just holding the space.*

---

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano) – Comping (D minor 7th chords)**  
**Chords on beats 2 and 4:**  
- **Beat 2:** D7 (D–F–A–C)  
- **Beat 4:** G7 (G–B–D–F)  
**Voicings:** Rootless, with extensions and color.  
**Rhythm:** 8th notes, comping on 2 and 4, leaving space for the melody to emerge.

> *Diane is not just playing chords — she’s painting the mood. She’s angry, yes, but she’s also listening. She’s waiting for your voice.*

---

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax) – Melody**  
**Melody (in D minor):**  
- **First note:** Bb (on beat 1) – a question.  
- **Second note:** A (on beat 2) – a hesitation.  
- **Third note:** G (on beat 3) – a step toward resolution.  
- **Fourth note:** rest (beat 4) – leave it hanging.  

> *This is the moment. The first real sound. The thing that makes Wayne lean in. No scale runs — just a simple, haunting motif, incomplete, like a door that's almost open.*

---

### **Bar 4: Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- D → Eb → F → G (same line as before)  
**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on beat 2: D7  
- Comp on beat 4: G7  
**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hats on every 8th  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Repeat the motif from bar 3, but **this time, finish it**.  
- End on D natural (beat 4) – a resolution that feels earned.

> *You come back, you finish what you started. That’s the moment. That’s the doorway. And Wayne — he’s not just listening now. He’s *watching*.*

**Final Note:**  
These four bars are not the beginning of a song — they’re the beginning of a sound. A story. A life. And if you play them right, Wayne Shorter might just smile.
