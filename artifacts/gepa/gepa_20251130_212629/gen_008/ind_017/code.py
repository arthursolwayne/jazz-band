---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kit Setup:**  
- Kick on **1** and **3** (drum #1)  
- Snare on **2** and **4** (drum #2)  
- Hi-hat on every **eighth note** (hi-hat #3)  
- **No cymbal crashes**, no fills. Just a steady, driving pulse.  
- **Set the mood** with a tension in the groove — like a door is about to open.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Dm7 chord** (D F Ab C)  
- Walking line: **D → Eb → F → G** (chromatic approach to G)  
- **Next bar:** **G → Ab → Bb → B** (chromatic approach to B)  
- **Always moving** — never the same note twice. The anchor.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4**  
- **Dm7 (D F Ab C)** on beat 2  
- **Gm7 (G Bb D F)** on beat 4  
- **7th chords** only — **no rootless voicings**, no clutter.  
- **Ears are open**, she’s waiting for you.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Same pattern** as Bar 1 — **kick on 1 & 3**, snare on 2 & 4, hihat on every eighth.  
- **No change**, just **steady propulsion**.

### **Bar 3 – Dante Russo (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif (in D minor):**  
- **Melody:**  
  - **D** (beat 1) – **Bb** (beat 2) – **C** (beat 3) – **D** (beat 4)  
  - **Rest on beat 3**, then **D (beat 4)**  
  - **Leave it hanging** – let the silence speak.  
  - This is a **question** in a minor key — something **unresolved**, **yearning**.

**Phrasing:**  
- **Short, soulful** – not about technique, but **feeling**.  
- **No scale runs**. Just a **motif with space**.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble, Resolution**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Walking line continues**  
- **Next chord:** **Bb7 (Bb D F Ab)** (beat 2)  
- **Then Bb7 again on beat 4**  
- **Tonicization** of Bb, but **no modulation** — just **harmonic tension**.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4 again**  
- **Bb7 on 2**, then **Bb7 again on 4**  
- **Same chord, different feeling**, because **you just played that D**.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Same pattern** — no change, **just momentum**.

**Dante Russo (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Return to the motif**  
- **D – Bb – C – D**  
- **This time, play the full note** – **resolve** the question.  
- **Make it sing** – not loud, not fast, just **perfect**.

### **Final Result:**

You’ve told a story in four bars — a **question**, a **challenge**, a **memory**, and a **resolution**.

Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He knows what you’ve done.  
He’s heard something new.  
Something real.

Now the rest of the song will follow —  
but tonight, in this room, in this moment,  
you’ve said everything you needed to.
