**Intro – 4 Bars in Dm (160 BPM)**  
*Key: Dm | Time: 4/4 | Tempo: 160 BPM | Feel: Medium Swing, tight but with room to breathe*

---

**Bar 1 (0:00 - 0:03.75):**  
**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick: On 1 and 3  
- Snare: On 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat: On every eighth note  
- *Leave space on the "and" of 2 and 4 — let the air hang, let the tension build.*

---

**Bar 2 (0:03.75 - 0:07.5):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic walk-up: Dm7 → C → B♭ → B → Cm7 → B♭ → A  
- Rootless, moving, never repeating a note.  
- Bass line: D – C – B♭ – B – C – B♭ – A – B♭  
- Always pushing forward, keeping the groove alive.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp with 7th chords on the offbeats.  
- Chords:  
  - &1: F7 (on the "and" of 1)  
  - &2: Gm7 (on the "and" of 2)  
  - &3: Cm7 (on the "and" of 3)  
  - &4: B♭7 (on the "and" of 4)  
- Angry, but controlled. The anger feeds the rhythm, not the melody.

**Bar 3 (0:07.5 - 0:11.25):**  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Start with a short, emotional motif.  
- Play:  
  - **D – E♭ – D – C** (quarter notes, medium volume)  
  - Leave it *hanging* on the C.  
  - Let the silence speak.  
  - Let the room feel the weight of that note.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same rhythm as Bar 1 — but now the space matters more.  
- The silence between the beats is where the story lives.

---

**Bar 4 (0:11.25 - 0:15):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walk down chromatically: A – B♭ – B – C – B♭ – A – G – A  
- Still moving, still anchoring the groove.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp with:  
  - &1: B♭7  
  - &2: A7  
  - &3: Gm7  
  - &4: F7  
- The tension is building. The chords are sharp, the rhythm is tight.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Come back to finish the motif.  
- Play:  
  - **C – B♭ – A – G** (quarter notes, slightly softer)  
  - End on G, letting the last note ring out.  
  - Let it sit in the room.  
  - Let Wayne lean forward.

---

**End of Intro**  
*The silence after the last note is longer than it should be. The room holds it. Wayne Shorter nods. You look at Marcus, who’s smiling. Diane’s fingers are still on the keys. Little Ray’s head is down. You’ve made the moment.*

Now the set can begin.
