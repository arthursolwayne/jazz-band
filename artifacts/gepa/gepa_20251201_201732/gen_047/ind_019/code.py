**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Set the mood. No cymbals, just the kick and snare, sparse but with intention.*  

- Kick on 1, 3  
- Snare on 2, 4  
- Hihat on every eighth (but soft, like a whisper)  
- **Feeling:** Suspense, a breath before the storm.

*Your moment. One short motif, with space and intent.*

**Final Impression:**  
The four bars feel like the edge of a cliff — not the place you fall from, but the moment you decide to look down. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The room holds its breath. You’ve planted the seed. Now it’s time to grow.
