**Kick:** On beats 1 and 3 (subtle, but present)  
**Snare:** On beats 2 and 4 (slightly behind the beat, like a whisper)  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (closed, tight, driving the pulse)  
**Fill:** At the end of the bar, a ghost note on the snare, just before beat 4, to leave tension unresolved.

> *The room holds its breath. The beat is there, but not loud. It’s waiting.*

### **Final Silence (End of Bar 4):**  
- No drum fill, no piano, no bass.  
- Just the saxophone note on beat 4, held slightly longer than the beat.  
- A space where the room holds its breath again.  
- Wayne Shorter nods.  
- The story begins.

---

**That’s the intro.**  
The kind that makes a legend lean forward.  
The kind that makes the silence speak.
