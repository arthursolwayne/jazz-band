**"Question in the Dark" – 4 Bar Intro in Dm (D minor), 160 BPM, 4/4 Time**

---

**BAR 1 – LITTLE RAY (DRUMS)**  
*Spaced, searching, with hihat breathing like a held breath.*

- **Kick**: on **1** and **3**, soft, but with a weight that lingers.
- **Snare**: on **2** and **4**, but muted, like a whisper.
- **Hi-hat**: on **& of 1**, **& of 2**, **& of 3**, **& of 4** – but not continuous. Space between each hit.  
  *Think of it like a heartbeat slowing down, waiting for a pulse to return.*

**Sound: Quiet, almost like the room holding its breath.**

---

**BAR 2 – THE BAND ENTERS**

**MARCUS (BASS)** –  
- **Walking line**, starting on **D**, then **F**, **G**, **Bb**, **C**, **Eb**, **F**, **Ab**.  
- Chromatic approach on **C** to **D**, subtle and low, like a voice in the dark.

**DIANE (PIANO)** –  
- **Comp on 2 and 4**, 7th chords:  
  - **2**: Dm7 (D-F-A-C)  
  - **4**: Gm7 (G-Bb-D-F)  
- She plays **soft**, but each chord is sharp, like a knife in the dark.  
- A **rest on beat 1** to let the question linger.

**LITTLE RAY (DRUMS)** –  
- Kick on **1 & 3**, snare on **2 & 4**, hihat on **every eighth**, but with **dynamic variation** – **louder** on 1 and 3, **quieter** on 2 and 4.

**YOU (TENOR SAX)** –  
- Play a **simple, haunting motif**:  
  - **D** (on beat 1), **F** (on & of 1), **G** (on 2), **rest** on 3.  
  - Let it **hang**, unresolved.  
  - That **F** is the question. That **G** is the first step toward an answer.  
  - But the **rest on 3** says: *Wait. Something is not here yet.*

**Sound: Tension. A memory trying to return.**

---

**BAR 3 – THE SEARCH BEGINS**

**MARCUS (BASS)** –  
- Chromatic approach on **G** to **A**, walking line continues, but now with a **slight syncopation** – **a little behind the beat**, like he’s thinking about it before playing.

**DIANE (PIANO)** –  
- Comp on **2 and 4** again, but now with a **slight, dissonant 9th on the 2** – **Dm9** (D-F-A-C-E).  
- She **plays it with fire**, like she’s got something to say.  
- A **rest on 4** to let the space speak.

**LITTLE RAY (DRUMS)** –  
- Kick on **1 & 3**, snare on **2 & 4**, hihat on **every eighth**.  
- **Fill on the & of 4** – a **snare roll**, soft but insistent.

**YOU (TENOR SAX)** –  
- Return to the motif, but **this time complete it**:  
  - **D** (beat 1), **F** (on & of 1), **G** (beat 2), **Eb** (beat 3), **D** (beat 4).  
  - The **Eb** is the answer, but only **halfway** – still unresolved.  
  - It’s not a resolution. It’s a **bridge** to somewhere deeper.

**Sound: A memory, half-remembered, but close now.**

---

**BAR 4 – THE ANSWER WAITS**

**MARCUS (BASS)** –  
- Chromatic approach on **Eb** to **D**, and then ends on **D**, with a **soft, open string** at the end.

**DIANE (PIANO)** –  
- Comp on **2 and 4** again, but now with a **9th on the 4** – **Gm9** (G-Bb-D-F-E).  
- A **rest on beat 1**, then a **low, slow, dissonant note on beat 2** – **Bb**, as if to say: *This is not what you expect.*

**LITTLE RAY (DRUMS)** –  
- Kick on **1 & 3**, snare on **2 & 4**, hihat on **every eighth**.  
- A **hi-hat fill on the & of 4**, soft, like a sigh.

**YOU (TENOR SAX)** –  
- Play the **same motif again**, but **this time with a slight variation**:  
  - **D** (beat 1), **F** (on & of 1), **G** (beat 2), **Eb** (beat 3), **D** (beat 4), **then a short, open note on the & of 4** – **F**, just above the D.  
  - That **F** is the question again.  
  - But this time, it’s **not the end**. It’s the **beginning of something else**.

**Sound: A question that has no answer yet — but it's the kind that lingers.**

**WAYNE SHORTER – HE LEANS FORWARD.**  
The first four bars are not just music.  
They're a story.  
A memory.  
A door that opens to something deeper.  
And he knows it.
