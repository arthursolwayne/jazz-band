**Key:** Dm (D minor)  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Duration:** 6 seconds (4 bars)

---

### **BAR 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth  
**Dynamic:** Starts soft, builds slightly  
**Feel:** Tense, expectant  
**Use:** Space between the hits — let the silence speak  

> *Kick (soft) — 1 – 3*  
> *Snare (light) — 2 – 4*  
> *Hi-hat — 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &*  
> *End the bar with a faint cymbal wash, like a whisper of storm.*  

---

### **BAR 2 – Full Band Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
> Dm7 → B♭ → C → E♭ → F → G → A♭ → B♭  
> (Walking line, chromatic approaches, emotional bounce)  

**Diane (Piano):**  
> Comping with Dm7 on beat 2, then G7 on beat 4  
> Left hand: walking bass line (same as Marcus, but more percussive)  
> Right hand: voicings — Dm7 (D F A♭ C), G7 (G B D F), with a slight rubato feel  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
> Same pattern as Bar 1, but slightly louder, with a little more tension  
> End the bar with a snare roll that builds into the next bar  

---

### **BAR 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif (Dm scale, but with emotional intent):**  
> Notes: **D – F – E♭ – G**  
> Phrasing: *D (legato, low and dark)* → *F (tense, ascending)* → *E♭ (sliding into it, a question)* → *G (a breath, a pause)*  
> Let the note hang on the G, not resolving yet — leave it unresolved, like a memory that won’t let go  

> *Play the motif with a whispered confidence — not loud, but present. Let the silence after the G speak.*  

---

### **BAR 4 – Full Band Resolves (but not completely)**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
> Dm7 → B♭ → C → E♭ → F → G → A♭ → B♭  
> (Same line, but slightly faster, with more urgency)  

**Diane (Piano):**  
> Dm7 on 2, G7 on 4 again  
> Right hand: Dm7 (D F A♭ C), G7 (G B D F)  
> Left hand: same as before, but with a slight syncopation  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
> Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4  
> Hi-hat on every eighth, but this time with a little more intensity  
> End the bar with a *rim shot* on beat 4 — sharp, like a door slamming shut  

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
> Repeat the motif from Bar 3, but end on **C** (not G)  
> *C* as a dissonant resolution — not a full answer, but a pause, a question, a memory that lingers  

> *Let the note hang — don’t close the door. Leave it open for Wayne to walk through.*

### **Final Note (Unwritten):**  
You don’t need to play the final note.  
Sometimes, the silence is the most powerful sound of all.  

Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He’s heard it.  
He’s listening.
