**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Key:** D minor  
**Key Signature:** 1 flat (Bb)  
**Style:** Modern Jazz, introspective with urgency  

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Soft, but precise. The room holds its breath.*

- Kick on **1** and **3** (very light, almost like a whisper)
- Snare on **2** and **4** (snappy, but not loud)
- Hi-hat on every eighth note (quiet, like a heartbeat)
- **No cymbal crash, no fill. Just the rhythm.**  
- *The tension builds in the silence between the beats.*

**Bar 2 – Enter the Rhythm Section**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **D – C – Bb – A** (walking line, descending chromatically)  
- **Next beat:** **G – F – Eb – D** (chromatic approach to the next chord)  
- **Phrasing:** Long, drawn-out notes, with subtle vibrato. He’s the anchor, but he’s leading the way forward.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chord on beat 2:** Dm7 (D – F – A – C)  
- **Chord on beat 4:** G7 (G – B – D – F)  
- **Comping style:** Smooth, but with a bit of push — not too soft, not too aggressive. It’s the emotional undercurrent.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on **1** and **3**  
- Snare on **2** and **4**  
- Hi-hat on every eighth, but slightly louder now.  
- *The energy is rising, but it’s still controlled.*

---

**Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
*Your moment.*

- **Phrase:**  
  - **D** (long, breathy, on beat 1)  
  - **C** (on beat 2, slightly descending, with a slight rest between the notes)  
  - **Bb** (on beat 3, full, resonant, but not loud)  
  - **A** (on beat 4, trailing off just before the end of the bar)  
- *It’s not a run, it’s a question. A memory. A ghost in the cellar.*

---

**Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
*The return.*

- **Phrase:**  
  - **G** (on beat 1, answer to the question from Bar 3)  
  - **F** (on beat 2, resolving but not closing the door)  
  - **Eb** (on beat 3, a breath, a pause)  
  - **D** (on beat 4, full, but with a slight space before it settles)  
- *You don’t finish the thought — you open the door. You invite Wayne to walk in.*

---

**Final Moment (After the 4th bar):**  
- Silence.  
- The room holds it.  
- Wayne Shorter sips his whiskey.  
- He leans forward.  
- The journey begins.

And don’t forget to breathe.
