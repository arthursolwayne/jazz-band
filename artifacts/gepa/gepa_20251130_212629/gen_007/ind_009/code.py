**Key:** Fm (F minor)  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Duration:** 4 bars = 6.0 seconds  
**Feel:** Tense, cinematic, with a slow-burn intensity. Like a storm gathering on the horizon.

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3 only (no 2 or 4).  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4.  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note, but **deliberately soft**, like a whisper.  
**Fill:** A single open hi-hat at the end of the bar (beat 4), **just before the sound cuts out**.  
**Purpose:** Create that breath before the storm — silence, tension, anticipation.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Beat 1:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb)  
- **Beat 2:** Chromatic walk down from D to C (D → C# → C)  
- **Beat 3:** Bbm7 (Bb, Db, F, Ab)  
- **Beat 4:** Ab7 (Ab, C, Eb, Gb)  
**Purpose:** Walking bass with chromatic tension, never repeating a note. Anchor the sound.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Beat 2:** Left hand: Ab7 (Ab, C, Eb, Gb)  
- **Beat 4:** Left hand: Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
- **Right hand:** Play a **chromatic run** from F up to Ab, then resolve to a **Bbm7 chord**.  
**Purpose:** Comp on 2 and 4, adding color and forward motion without clashing.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick:** 1 & 3  
- **Snare:** 2 & 4  
- **Hi-hat:** Eighths, accenting the "and" of 2 and 4  
- **Fill:** A simple half-time snare roll on beat 4  
**Purpose:** Push the energy forward, but not too fast — just enough to suggest urgency.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- Play a **short, singable motif** starting on F, ascending chromatically to Ab.  
- Notes: **F → Gb → G → Ab** (quarter notes, played with a **smooth, slow legato**, no rush)  
- End on **Ab**, **leaving it hanging** — not resolving, just **implying** a question.  
**Purpose:** That’s your moment. Make it sound like **something is waiting to be said**.

- **Beat 1:** Chord: Ebm7  
- **Beat 2:** Chord: D7  
- **Beat 3:** Chord: Bbm7  
- **Beat 4:** Chord: F7 (F, A, C, Eb)

- **Kick:** 1 & 3  
- **Snare:** 2 & 4  
- **Hi-hat:** Eighths, **more aggressive**, **slightly louder**  
- **Fill:** Open snare on beat 3, then a quick roll to beat 4  
**Purpose:** The energy is rising, but the rhythm is still **grounded**.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- Repeat the same motif: **F → Gb → G → Ab**  
- But now, **play it a half-step higher** — **Gb → Ab → A → Bb**  
- Still on quarter notes, **same phrasing, same tone**, but **a half-step up**  
- End on **Bb**, **still unresolved**  
**Purpose:** You’re not just repeating the question — you’re **shifting the key** subtly, making it **unpredictable**.

- **Beat 3:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb)

- **Beat 2:** Chord: Fm7  
- **Beat 3:** Chord: Eb7

- **Snare:** 2 & 4  
- **Hi-hat:** Eighths, **full volume**, **driven**  
- **Fill:** A **simple but powerful** open hi-hat and snare on beat 4  
**Purpose:** The energy is **maxed out**, but it’s **controlled**.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- Play the same motif again, but now **on Bb**  
- **Bb → Cb → C → Db** (chromatic, quarter notes)  
- End on **Db**, **leaving it open**  
- Your face is **tense**, **focused**, **watching Wayne**  
**Purpose:** You didn’t just play four bars — you **posed a question** that **Wayne Shorter can’t ignore**.

---

**Final Note:**  
You didn’t resolve the tension, you **aggravated it**.  
You didn’t play a melody — you **posed a problem**.  
You didn’t please the crowd — you **challenged them**.

And **Wayne Shorter leans forward**.  
That’s all you needed.
