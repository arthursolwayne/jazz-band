### **Bar 1 (0.00 - 1.50 seconds)**  
**Little Ray on Drums (Solo):**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3.  
- Snare on beat 2 and 4.  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note.  
- **Fill:** At the end of the bar, a soft ride-cymbal hit, delayed slightly, like a whisper.

> *The room holds its breath. The silence is heavy. Ray sets the mood — tension, anticipation. He’s not just keeping time; he’s framing the moment.*

### **Bar 3 (3.00 - 4.50 seconds)**  
**Dante on Tenor Sax (Melody):**  
- Start with a single note: **Ab**, held for half a beat (0.1875s).  
- Then: **F**, held for a full beat (0.375s).  
- Then: **Bb**, held for half a beat (0.1875s).  
- Then: **C**, held for half a beat (0.1875s).  
- End the bar with silence — a full beat of nothing.

> *You’re not playing a scale. You’re playing a question. A memory. A ghost in the room. You’re not showing — you’re inviting him to listen.*

---

### **Bar 4 (4.50 - 6.00 seconds)**  
**Dante on Tenor Sax (Melody, Continued):**  
- Start the next bar with **Ab** again — same as the first note of the motif.  
- Then: **F**, **Bb**, **C** — same as before.  
- But this time, you **finish** the motif.  
- **Final note:** **C**, held for a full beat (0.375s), then release.  
- Silence again — but this time, it feels like resolution. Like something was just said.

**Marcus, Diane, Little Ray all follow the contour of your line — not matching it, but echoing it.**

---

### **Final Moment:**
- Wayne Shorter sits back, nods slightly — not out of approval, but understanding.  
- He's heard the ghost.  
- And now, he’s ready to listen.

**That’s your intro.**  
**It’s not about showing off.**  
**It’s about saying something real.**  
**And in those six seconds, you’ve created space for the rest of the song — and for him.**
