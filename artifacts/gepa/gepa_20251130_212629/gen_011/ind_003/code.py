**Intro: "Ghost of the First Note"**  
*Key: Fm | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4 | Duration: 6.0 seconds*

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Kick on 1, 3 | Snare on 2, 4 | Hihat on every eighth | Cymbal swish on beat 3*  
A slow, deliberate build. No cymbal crash, no flourish—just a whisper of a heartbeat. The space between the hits is as important as the hits themselves. The tension is subtle but real. It's the moment before the storm.

---

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line in Fm, chromatic approach on beat 4 to the 3rd (D♭)*  
**Fm7** → **B♭♭7** → **Cm7** → **E♭7**  
**Fm7** → **B♭♭7** → **Cm7** → **E♭7**  
He doesn't play the same note twice. The line is smooth, but it leads nowhere—just a path that curves, like a river in the dark.

---

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp on 2 and 4 with 7th chords*  
**Fm7** on beat 2, **E♭7** on beat 4  
She plays with fire, but not for show. Her chords ring out, full and deep, like the sound of a door closing behind you.

---

**Bar 3 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Same pattern as bar 1 but slightly louder, with a snare roll on beat 3*  
Now the tension is higher. The room is holding its breath. You can feel it in the air.

---

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Chromatic approach to the 7th (E♭) on beat 3*  
**Fm7** → **B♭♭7** → **Cm7** → **E♭♭7**  
He’s leading you to the edge of the cliff.

---

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Same as bar 2, but with a descending trill on beat 3*  
She’s the storm, the warning, the inevitable.

---

**Bar 4 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Same pattern, now with a cymbal crash on beat 1*  
The moment is here.

---

**Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Resolves to Fm7 on beat 4*  
**Fm7**  
He gives you the ground to stand on.

---

**Bar 4 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Fm7 on beat 1, E♭7 on beat 2, Fm7 on beat 3, E♭7 on beat 4*  
She’s still pushing, still restless, but she’s with you now.

---

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif:**  
**F** (beat 1) → **A♭** (beat 2) → **C** (beat 3) → **F** (beat 4)  
But you **don’t** play the final F.  
You leave it hanging.  
You let the question live.  
You let it breathe.  
You let **Wayne** hear something he hasn’t heard before.

---

**End of Intro.**  
Silence.  
Air.  
A question.  
A ghost.  
A saxophone breath.
