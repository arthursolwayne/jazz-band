**Title: "Whispers in the Cellar"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Length: 4 bars (6 seconds)**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**
**Rhythm:**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hihat on every eighth note  
- *No cymbal crash, just a steady pulse like a heartbeat.*  
- *Gentle, but urgent — the kind of groove that makes you lean in.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **F – G♭ – G – A♭**  
- Walking line, chromatic approach to G  
- **G – A♭ – A – B♭**  
- **B♭ – B – C – C♯** (chromatic run up to the third)  
- **C – B – A – G** (descending back to F)  
- *He’s the anchor, but he’s reaching — not just walking, but searching.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - **2nd beat:** F7 (F, A, C, E♭)  
  - **4th beat:** G7 (G, B, D, F)  
- *She plays only on 2 and 4, with rich, spicy 7th chords. Her left hand is just a single, sly walking bass line, not the full thing — she’s leaving space for the story to unfold.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same pattern as Bar 1, but now with a *slight* emphasis on the 3rd beat — like a breath before the line begins.

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif (Starts on the 3rd beat):**  
- **F – G – A♭ – G**  
- *A simple, haunting phrase. The first note is a long, breathy F — like a whisper. The G is a question. The A♭ is a memory. The return to G is hesitation.*

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **F – G – A♭ – G** (same motif, one octave lower)  
- *He’s echoing you — not imitating, but answering.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 3:**  
  - **2nd beat:** F7 (same as before)  
  - **4th beat:** A7 (A, C♯, E, G)  
- *She’s supporting the tension, pushing the harmony forward without being too busy.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Fills on the 3rd beat with a quick *brush stroke* on the snare — a punctuation mark in the middle of the sentence.

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif (Finish):**  
- **F – G – A♭ – F**  
- *The last note is a long, held F — a resolution, but not a full one. It lingers, like the end of a story you want to hear again.*

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **F – G – A♭ – F** (same motif, lower)  
- *He’s closing the loop with you, grounding it in the bass.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 4:**  
  - **2nd beat:** F7 again  
  - **4th beat:** F7 (same as start)  
- *She circles back to the beginning, closing the chord, but not resolving the tension.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Final beat: **Kick on 1, snare on 4** — a subtle *end* but not a *finish*. Silence follows.

---

### **Final Silence:**
- 1.5 seconds of nothing.  
- The room holds its breath.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.

---

**That’s it.**  
A whisper, a question, a story waiting to be told.  
You don’t need to run. You just need to *mean* it.
