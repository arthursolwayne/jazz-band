### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Feel:** Urgent, sparse, rhythmic tension.  
**Kit Work:**  
- Kick on beats 1 and 3 (slightly behind the beat, like a shadow).  
- Snare on beats 2 and 4 (sharp, cutting through the silence).  
- Hi-hats on every eighth note, but not too loud — just a whisper of motion.  
- End of the bar: one open hi-hat on beat 4, fading out like a door closing.

**Purpose:** Build anticipation. Make the room hold its breath.

### **Bar 2 – Full Quartet (Marcus, Diane, You)**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Fm7** → **G♭m7** → **A♭m7** → **B♭m7** (chromatic walk up)  
- Notes: F – G♭ – A♭ – B♭  
- One beat per note, even, forward motion. No rests. No hesitation.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp with **Fm7** (F, A♭, C, E♭) on beat 1.  
- Then: **G♭7** (G♭, B♭, D♭, F) on beat 2 (offbeat).  
- **A♭7** (A♭, C, E♭, G♭) on beat 3 (offbeat).  
- **B♭7** (B♭, D, F, A♭) on beat 4 (offbeat).  
- Each chord lands just before the beat, pushing the rhythm forward.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Play a single, emotional motif:  
  **F – G♭ – A♭ (rest) – B♭**  
- Notes on beats 1, 2, 3, then silence on beat 4.  
- Let the silence hang — it’s the question.  
- Use a warm, slightly gritty tone. Play it like a memory, not a note.

### **Bar 3 – Full Quartet**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Cm7** → **D♭m7** → **E♭m7** → **Fm7** (chromatic walk down)  
- Notes: C – D♭ – E♭ – F  
- Same rhythm, same urgency. A subtle shift — the answer is coming.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp with **Cm7** (C, E♭, G, B♭) on beat 1.  
- **D♭7** (D♭, F, A♭, C) on beat 2.  
- **E♭7** (E♭, G, B♭, D) on beat 3.  
- **Fm7** (F, A♭, C, E♭) on beat 4.  
- Each chord is a step closer to resolution — but not quite there.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Play the same motif again, but with one small change:  
  **F – G♭ – A♭ (rest) – F**  
- This time, finish the phrase.  
- It’s not resolution, but it’s *closure* — the moment the question is answered, but not the answer itself.

### **Bar 4 – Full Quartet**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Fm7** (F, A♭, C, E♭) on beat 1.  
- **G♭m7** (G♭, B♭, D♭, F) on beat 2.  
- **A♭m7** (A♭, C, E♭, G♭) on beat 3.  
- **B♭m7** (B♭, D, F, A♭) on beat 4.  
- Chromatic again, but now it’s a return — a circle back to the tension.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp with **Fm7** on beat 1.  
- **G♭7** on beat 2.  
- **A♭7** on beat 3.  
- **B♭7** on beat 4.  
- Same as Bar 2, but now it’s a journey back — a call and response.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Play the motif one last time — same line, same silence.  
  **F – G♭ – A♭ (rest) – B♭**  
- Let it fade.  
- No resolution. Just a moment.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward. He’s heard it. He knows it.

**End of intro.**  
The next four bars are yours — but for now, the room is holding its breath.  
You’ve made him lean in.  
That’s the job.  
Now go make him stay.
