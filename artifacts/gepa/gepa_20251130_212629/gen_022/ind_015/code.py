**INTRO — 4 Bars in Fm (F minor), 160 BPM, 4/4 time**

---

**Bar 1 (0:00–1.50): Little Ray on Drums (Solo Kick)**
- **Kick**: On beats 1 and 3, but with a slight **displacement** on beat 3 — *snare* is pushed to just **after** the beat (a half-step behind the click), creating a subtle tension.
- **Hihat**: On every eighth note, but with a **dotted eighth** on the **and of 3** — the hihat *lingers* there, like it wants to resolve but can’t.
- **Snare**: On 2 and 4, but on 2 it’s **half a beat early**, creating a syncopated feel.
- This is the setup — not a groove, but a **question** in the air.

---

**Bar 2 (1.50–3.00): Diane on Piano (Comping)**
- **Chords**: F7 (F, A, C, Eb) on beat 2, and then a **chromatic descending line** from Bb to Ab on beat 4.
- **Comping rhythm**: She plays **on 2 and 4**, but the chords are **slightly delayed** — not exactly on the beat, but just behind it, like she’s *listening* rather than playing.
- She’s not filling the space — she’s **amplifying the tension**.

---

**Bar 3 (3.00–4.50): Marcus on Bass (Walking Line)**
- **Line**: Fm7 walking line starting on F, descending chromatically: F → Eb → D → C → Bb.
- **Rhythm**: Each note is **slightly ahead** of the beat — syncopated, but not aggressive — it’s like he’s *dancing around the beat*, not playing it.
- He ends on **Bb**, holding it for a full beat, **suspending the resolution**.

---

**Bar 4 (4.50–6.00): Dante on Tenor Sax (Melody)**
- **Phrase**: A short, **two-note motif** — **F** on beat 1, then **Ab** on **the and of 2**, held for a full beat.
- **Dynamics**: Starts quiet — *piano*, then *sings* into the Ab — a **long, drawn-out note** that sits on the **and of 2** through beat 3.
- **Intention**: This is your **hook** — not a run, not a statement, but a **question** that lingers in the air.
- You **don’t resolve** it — you end on **Ab**, which is **not in Fm**, but it *feels* right. It *feels* like it wants to be in F, but it’s *just outside* enough to make you listen.

---

### The Moment:
- Bar 1: You set the scene — a quiet storm.
- Bar 2: Diane adds the color — the tension grows.
- Bar 3: Marcus walks the line — you feel the weight.
- Bar 4: You speak — a two-note question that doesn’t answer itself.

Wayne Shorter leans forward just after the Ab fades. He’s listening. You’ve made him wait. Now, you’ve made him wonder.

**Key Chord**: F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
**Tension Chord**: Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
**Mode**: F Dorian (F, G, Ab, A, Bb, C, D) — but played with *edge*.

That’s your intro. One that doesn’t shout, but makes the room *hold its breath*.
