Kick ————————  
Snare ————————  
Hi-hat ————————

Walking line in Fm. Chromatic approach to Fm7.

This is your moment.  
*Phrase:*  
**1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &**  
F ———— G♭ ———— (rest) ———— F ————  
(Short motif, starts strong, lands on the root. Leaves it hanging — but not empty.)

*Note:*  
**1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &**  
F ———— G♭ ———— G ———— F ————

Fm7 ————————  
Fm7 ————————  
(Reiterates the key, keeps the story in Fm.)

Full pattern, but with a slight cymbal swells on the 4th beat to leave a breath.

**Final Thought:**  
You’ve just played a line that’s not a quote, not a cliché — it’s a question. You’ve left him hanging. You’ve said, *“I’ve got something to show you.”*  
He leans forward.  
You’ve made your point.  
Now, the rest of the song is just the answer.
