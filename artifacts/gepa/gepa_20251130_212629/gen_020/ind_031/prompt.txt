Create a piece that breathes. Let silence be a player. Use rhythm as a storyteller, not just a clock. Give each instrument space to speak, and let them listen. When the saxophone begins, make it feel like a question — something that lingers, unanswered, before returning to finish the thought. In the piano, let the chords be color, not noise. In the bass, move like a river — always flowing, never repeating the same path. In the drums, make every hit count — not just for rhythm, but for emotion. Let the music have moments that feel like pauses, not just gaps.
