### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** 1, 3  
**Snare:** 2, 4  
**Hi-Hat:** On every eighth note  
**Fill:** A quick brush stroke on the snare just before the end of the bar, like a door closing.

### **Bar 2: Marcus (Bass)**

| D2 — F2 — G2 — Ab2 — G2 — F2 — D2 — C2 |

### **Bar 3: Marcus (Bass)**  
**Walking Line (D2-G2, MIDI 38-43):**  
| C2 — Bb2 — B2 — C2 — Bb2 — B2 — C2 — D2 |

### **Bar 3: Diane (Piano – Comp)**  
**Chord (Bb7):**  
Left hand: Bb — F — D — Ab  
Right hand: Open voicing: Bb, D, F, Ab  
**Comp on 2 and 4:**

### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax – Melody)**  
**Motif:**  
**Phrase:**  
C7 (G) — Eb7 (C) — Fm7 (Ab) — Bb7 (D)  
**Note Values:**  
- C7 (G): Eighth note  
- Eb7 (C): Eighth note  
- Fm7 (Ab): Quarter note  
- Bb7 (D): Quarter note  

**Phrasing:**  
Start on the “&” of 1, play the first two notes (C7 and Eb7), leave the third note (Ab) hanging, then resolve with D on the last quarter note.  

**Feel:** The memory — you see it, you feel it, you almost reach for it, but it slips away. But the D is there, the resolution, the moment that matters.

---

### **Bar 4: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** 1, 3  
**Snare:** 2, 4  
**Hi-Hat:** On every eighth note

**End of Intro.**  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
It’s the first time he’s heard that sound.

**You look up.**  
He’s smiling.  
And the rest of the night is yours.
