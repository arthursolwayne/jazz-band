---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums) – The Question**

**Kit:**
- Kick on beat 1 and 3.
- Snare on beat 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat on every eighth note, but **crescendo into the bar**, starting soft and building tension.
- A subtle cymbal splash on the “& of 4” to hold the space.

**Feel:**
- Tense, suspenseful, like a door about to open.
- No melody, just rhythm building.

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble – The Answer Begins**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Root movement: F – B♭ – C – G  
- Walking line:  
  - F (root)  
  - G♭ (chromatic approach to G)  
  - G  
  - A♭ (chromatic approach to A)  
  - A  
  - B♭ (root of next chord)  
  - This is a **chromatic walk-up** over F7, resolving to B♭7.

**Diane (Piano – Left Hand):**  
- Comping on 2 and 4 with 7th chords:
  - **F7** (F, A, C, E♭) on beat 2  
  - **B♭7** (B♭, D, F, A♭) on beat 4

**Diane (Piano – Right Hand):**  
- A simple, **melodic line** that mirrors your motif, but a half-step behind:
  - E♭ – D – C – B♭  
  - (This is a chromatic descent, almost a **melodic minor scale** idea, but with tension.)

### **Bar 3: Dante (Tenor Sax) – The Melody Begins**

You take a **simple 4-note motif** over F7, played in a way that's fresh but **familiar** – like a memory:

- **Phrase:** B♭ – A – G – F  
- **Rhythm:** Quarter note – eighth note – eighth note – quarter note  
- **Phrasing:** Play the first note (B♭) on the downbeat, then let the rest fall like a question.

**Technique:**  
- B♭ is played with a slight **growl** in the lower register, to give it weight.  
- The note G is “bent” slightly upward, for a touch of blues.  
- End on F, held for a half-beat, letting the room **breathe**.

### **Bar 4: Full Ensemble – The Answer Resolves**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic walk continues:  
  - G – A – B♭ – F  
  - (Again, a walk-up to a new chord, but this time, resolving to a **Fmaj7**)

**Diane (Piano – Left Hand):**  
- Comping on beat 2 and 4:
  - **B♭7** on beat 2  
  - **Fmaj7** on beat 4

**Diane (Piano – Right Hand):**  
- She answers your motif with a **mirror melody** but a half-step above:
  - C – B – A – G  
  - (Again, a chromatic idea, but this time ascending into resolution.)

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Full kit now:  
  - Kick on 1 and 3  
  - Snare on 2 and 4  
  - Hi-hat on every 8th  
  - A **fill** on beat 3 (a triplet run on the snare, leading into the last beat)

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- You **repeat your motif**, but this time, you **resolve** the last note (F) with a **slight vibrato**, **leaning into the note**.

### **Final Moment:**

The last note of your phrase hangs in the air — **F** on the downbeat of bar 4 — and for a moment, the room **holds its breath**.

Wayne Shorter, in the back, leans forward.

It's not about technique. It's about **truth**.

You've made him remember something he didn't know he'd forgotten.
