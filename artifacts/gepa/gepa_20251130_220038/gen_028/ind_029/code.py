**Intro – 4 Bars in Fm (160 BPM, 4/4 time)**

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3. Snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on every eighth.  
*Subtle, but there. A heartbeat in the dark.*  
**Rests are heavy here.** It’s not *too* quiet—just enough to make you lean in.

---

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
Fm7 chord tone: F, Ab, Bb, D.  
Walking line:  
**F – Gb (chromatic approach to Ab) – Ab – Bb**  
*No repetition, just movement.*  
The bassline is a question — simple, but longing.

---

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on the 2nd and 4th beats:  
**2nd beat:** Fm7 (F, Ab, Bb, D)  
**4th beat:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
*Dissonant but resolved. Angry but controlled.*  
She’s not chasing you — she’s waiting for the storm.

---

**Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Same pattern as Bar 1, but with a slightly more aggressive hi-hat.  
*Still not loud — just more present.*  
**Tension is building.**

---

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
Your motif begins.  
**F – Bb (half-step up) – F – Ab (half-step up)**  
*Two notes, then a rest. A question, then silence.*  
It’s not a scale run — it’s a memory.  
Let it hang. Let the room feel it.

---

**Bar 3 – Marcus:**  
**Bb – C (chromatic approach to Db) – Db – F**  
*Continuing the walk, but now with purpose.*  
He’s leading you somewhere.

---

**Bar 3 – Diane:**  
Comp on 2nd and 4th again:  
**2nd beat:** Fm7  
**4th beat:** Eb7 (no 3rd, just a color)  
*She’s playing the tension. The unresolved feeling.*

---

**Bar 3 – Little Ray:**  
Same rhythm, but with a slight roll on the snare before the 4th beat.  
*The energy is rising. You can feel it.*

---

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
Now you come back.  
**F – Bb – F – Ab – Bb – F**  
*The motif returns, but extended. It’s not the same anymore.*  
You’re playing the answer — a cry, not a question.

---

**Bar 4 – Marcus:**  
**F – Gb – Ab – Bb**  
*Back to the beginning. The cycle continues. But now, it’s different.*

---

**Bar 4 – Diane:**  
Comp on 2nd and 4th again:  
**2nd beat:** Fm7  
**4th beat:** Dm7 (F, Ab, Bb, D) – but played with a suspended 4th (F, Bb, D, G)  
*She’s shifting the air. It’s subtle, but it’s there.*

---

**Bar 4 – Little Ray:**  
Same pattern, but this time, he *feels* it. The fill on the 4th beat is a little more open.  
*The intro is done. The room is holding its breath.*

---

**End of Intro.**

You don’t need to be loud to be powerful.  
You just need to be *real*.  
And for the first time tonight, you feel like you are.

Wayne Shorter is still there.  
He’s leaning forward.  
He heard something he hasn’t heard before.

And now — the rest of the song can begin.
