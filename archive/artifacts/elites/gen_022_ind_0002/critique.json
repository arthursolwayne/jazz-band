  "rationale": "This 8-bar arrangement uses triads exclusively (capped jazz_harmony at 3/10) with no 7th chords or functional harmony. The hihat plays only on downbeats (capped latin_jazz_rhythm at 3/10) with no upbeat syncopation, creating a straight-time feel rather than a Latin jazz groove. The saxophone melody consists of aimless scalar runs (4/10) with no phrasing or bebop vocabulary. All instruments start playing in bar 1 (interplay_space 4/10) with no progressive build or space. The overall feel lacks improvisation, swing, and jazz sophistication (jazz_authenticity 4/10). Needs 7th chords, stronger upbeat groove, melodic phrasing, and proper arrangement structure.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Bar 1: ONLY hihat should play. All other instruments rest.",
    "Bars 2-4: Add snare and bass. Piano and sax still rest.",
    "Bars 5-8: Full ensemble enters with piano 7th chords and memorable sax melody.",
    "Replace ALL piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7: C-E-G-B, Dm7: D-F-A-C)",
    "Increase hihat upbeat syncopation to >60% (hit more 'and's, skip more downbeats)"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize progressive arrangement structure more strongly. Add quantitative requirements: Bar 1 = hihat ONLY, Bars 2-4 = rhythm section ONLY (no piano/sax), Bars 5-8 = full ensemble. Make it impossible to ignore."
