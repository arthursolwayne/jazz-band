**Title: "The Door Ajar"**  
*Key: F minor | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time Signature: 4/4 | Duration: 6 seconds*

---

**Bar 1 (0.00 - 1.50s): Little Ray on Drums**  
- **Kick**: On beat 1 only — low, deep, like a breath held.  
- **Snare**: Beat 2 and 4 — crisp, but with a slight *delay* on beat 4 (0.375s before the beat).  
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth note, but **beat 3 is muted**, creating a ghost note that feels just off.  
- **Fill**: A half-time snare roll on beat 3, ending just before the downbeat of bar 2.  
- **Dynamic**: Soft, almost imperceptible. A whisper of tension.

**Bar 2 (1.50 - 3.00s): Full Ensemble Enters**  
- **Marcus (Bass)**:  
  - Fm7 chord (F, Ab, C, Dbb) — but he plays a walking line starting on **Ab** (beat 1).  
  - Line: Ab → G → F → Eb (chromatic descent), then G → Ab → Bb → C (ascending with a minor 9th).  
  - **Rest on beat 4** — silence. A pause that hangs.

- **Diane (Piano)**:  
  - Comp on **beats 2 and 4**.  
  - **Beat 2**: Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Dbb) — rootless, with a Bb in the right hand.  
  - **Beat 4**: F7♭9 (F, Ab, C, E, Bb) — sharp, angular, but with a soft dynamic.  
  - **Left hand**: Walking bass line, but **starts late** (beat 2), as if reacting to the space.

- **Little Ray (Drums)**:  
  - Kick on beat 1 and 3.  
  - Snare on 2 and 4, but **beat 2 is delayed by 0.1s**, as if he’s just catching up.  
  - Hi-hat on every eighth.  
  - **Fill at the end of the bar**: A quick triplet on the snare, but **not resolving** — it stops mid-fill.

**Bar 3 (3.00 - 4.50s): You (Tenor Sax) — Enter with the Melody**  
- **Phrase**: A short, haunting motif.  
- **Notes (in Fm):**  
  - **Beat 1**: G (on the beat, strong, but slightly behind the pulse)  
  - **Beat 2**: E♭ (off the beat, syncopated, with a slight pause before it)  
  - **Beat 3**: F (falling on the beat, but **with a fermata** — held just a bit too long)  
  - **Beat 4**: Rest — silence.  
- **Dynamic**: Crescendo into the G, then decrescendo into the rest.  
- **Phrasing**: It's not a statement — it's a question. A voice asking if the room is ready.  
- **Tone**: Warm, but with a slight edge — like the sax is leaning into the mic, whispering something you’re not sure you’re supposed to hear.

**Bar 4 (4.50 - 6.00s): Resolution That Is Not A Resolution**  
- **Marcus**:  
  - Same walking line as in bar 2, but now with **a slight hesitation** on beat 4 — he plays a tonic F, but **holds it for half a beat too long**.  
- **Diane**:  
  - Comp on beat 2 (Fm7), but **beat 4 is a passing chord** — Dm7 — unresolved.  
- **Little Ray**:  
  - Kick on 1 and 3.  
  - Snare on 2 and 4, but **beat 4 is just a ghost note**, barely there.  
  - Hi-hat continues, but **ends on beat 3**, not 4.  
- **You (Tenor Sax)**:  
  - Play the **same motif**, but **start it half a beat later** — like you’re answering your own question, but with a delay.  
  - End on a **rest** — the final note is **not played**.  
  - The last sound is the **hi-hat on beat 3** — a small, sharp *click* that feels like the door closing — just slightly ajar.

**Final Moment**:  
- The room is silent.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- You wait.

**The intro is done.**  
But the question hangs.
