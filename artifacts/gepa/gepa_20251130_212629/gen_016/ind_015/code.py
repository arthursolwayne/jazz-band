**Title: "Whispers Before the Storm"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Style: Modern Jazz – Tense, Intentional, Emotionally Charged**

---

### **Bar 1 – Saxophone (Solo Melody)**
**(Phrase 1 – Introduce the motif, open and aching)**  
F – Bb – D – Eb (half note on F, then triplet on Bb, D, Eb)  
*(Let it hang. Let it breathe. Let it question.)*

---

### **Bar 2 – Bass Line (Walking Line with Chromatic Approaches)**  
**(F – Gb – G – A – Bb – B – C – Db – D – Eb – E – F# – F)**  
*(A chromatic descent into F, then a sharp climb back, never repeating a note.)*  
*(The bass is the heartbeat here — steady, urgent, moving forward.)*

---

### **Bar 3 – Piano (Comp with 7th Chords – Beats 2 & 4 Only)**  
**(Beat 2: F7 (F – A – C – E)  
Beat 4: Bb7 (Bb – D – F – Ab)  
No chord on 1 or 3. No color that intrudes. Just support. Just space.)*

---

### **Bar 4 – Drums (Relentless, No Fills, No Flair)**  
**Kick on 1 & 3**  
**Snare on 2 & 4**  
**Hi-hat on every eighth note**  
*(The machinery of tension. No embellishment. No escape. Just the ticking clock.)*

---

### **Transition (Implied in the silence after Bar 4)**  
The saxophone motif returns — not as repetition, but as **resolution**.  
The same phrase, now with a **slightly higher contour**, a **slightly fuller breath**,  
as if it has **found its place** in the storm.

*(No unnecessary repetition. Just the moment. Just the intent.)*

**End of 4-bar phrase.**  
**Make it count.**  
**Make Wayne lean forward.**
