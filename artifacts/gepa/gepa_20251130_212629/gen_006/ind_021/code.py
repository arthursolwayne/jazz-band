**Title: "Door Open"**  
**Key:** Dm (D minor)  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM, 4/4 time  
**Time:** 4 bars = 6.0 seconds  
**Mood:** Mysterious, searching, resonant — like a door creaks open in the dark.

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Fill:** A subtle, tight rimshot on the "and" of 2, building tension.

> *The room holds its breath. A hush. The heartbeat of the room begins.*

---

### **Bars 2–4 – Full Ensemble:**

#### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
**Left Hand:** Walking bass line in Dm, with chromatic passing tones:  
- Dm7 (D F A C)  
- Gm7 (G Bb D F)  
- Cm7 (C Eb G Bb)  
- Fm7 (F Ab C Eb)  
> *A steady, grounded line, each chord a shadow of the next. The tension is there, but it's not answered yet.*

**Right Hand:** Comping on 2 and 4:  
- Dm7 (D F A C) on beat 2  
- Fm7 (F Ab C Eb) on beat 4  
> *Sparse but rich. Let the silence between the chords speak.*

---

#### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
**Walking line:**  
- D → Eb → F → G  
- A (chromatic accent on beat 3) → Bb → C → D  
> *He’s the anchor, but he’s reaching. A little tension, a question in the bassline.*

---

#### **Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick:** 1, 3  
**Snare:** 2, 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth  
> *The energy builds, but stays precise. No rushing — just the pulse of the moment.*

---

#### **Bar 2 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif (starting on beat 2):**  
- D (beat 2) → F (beat 3) → Eb (beat 4)  
> *A short, searching phrase. It ends on Eb — unresolved, but not chaotic. It's like the door is open, but you're not sure what's on the other side.*

---

#### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
**Left Hand:**  
- Bbm7 (Bb D F Ab)  
- Ebm7 (Eb G Bb D)  
- Abm7 (Ab C Eb G)  
- Dm7 (D F A C)  
> *The bassline continues, but now with a subtle chromatic pull toward D.*

**Right Hand:**  
- Bbm7 on beat 2  
- Dm7 on beat 4  
> *She's leaning into the resolution now. The chords breathe, but don’t close the door.*

---

#### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
**Walking line:**  
- D → Eb → F → G  
- A → Bb → C → D  
> *Still walking, still reaching. He's the anchor, but he's not afraid to drift.*

---

**Same pattern as Bar 2, but slightly more dynamic.**

---

#### **Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif (starting on beat 2):**  
- D (beat 2) → F (beat 3) → Eb (beat 4)

---

**Left Hand:**  
- Dm7 (D F A C)  
- Gm7 (G Bb D F)  
- Cm7 (C Eb G Bb)  
- Fm7 (F Ab C Eb)  
> *Back to the beginning, but now with more weight. The cycle starts again, but it feels different now.*

**Right Hand:**  
- Dm7 on beat 2  
> *One chord — a breath — and it’s enough.*

---

#### **Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass):**  
**Walking line:**  
- D → Eb → F → G  
> *He ends on G, a half-step above D — a subtle question, a bridge between what was and what could be.*

---

#### **Bar 4 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Same pattern as before, but now with a slight roll on beat 4 — a gentle release.**

---

#### **Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif (starting on beat 2):**  
- D (beat 2) → F (beat 3) → Eb (beat 4)  
> *Same phrase, same silence after it. But now it feels like a beginning. Like something is waiting.*

---

**Ending:**  
All instruments hold on the last beat, with a few seconds of silence before the rest of the tune begins.

> *Wayne Shorter leans forward. He’s listening. And he knows it’s the beginning of something new.*

Let that be your intro.
