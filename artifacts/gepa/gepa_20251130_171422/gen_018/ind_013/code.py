**Bar 1 (Drums – Little Ray):**  
- **Kick**: On beats 1 and 3, but with a slight delay on beat 3, giving a sense of hesitation.  
- **Snare**: On beat 2, then on the “and” of 4. Use a ghost note on the “and” of 2 to create tension.  
- **Hi-Hat**: Open on the “and” of 1 and 3, closed on the “and” of 2 and 4. Keep it light, but let it breathe—like a heartbeat.  
- **Cymbal**: A single ride cymbal hit on beat 4, just before the rest of the ensemble comes in.  

**Bar 2 (Bass – Marcus):**  
- **Walking line in Fm**:  
  - **Beat 1**: F  
  - **Beat 2**: G♭ (chromatic approach)  
  - **Beat 3**: E♭  
  - **Beat 4**: D♭  
  - **Beat “and” of 4**: C  
- Keep the line moving, never repeating the same note. Let the chromaticism whisper a question.

**Bar 2 (Piano – Diane):**  
- **Comping on 2 and 4**:  
  - **Beat 2**: F7 (F, A♭, C, E♭)  
  - **Beat 4**: B♭7 (B♭, D, F, A♭)  
- Use a left-hand bass line that moves up and down chromatically, never resolving.  
- Right hand: Play a dissonant voicing on beat 2, then a suspending chord on beat 4 that feels unresolved.

**Bar 2 (Sax – Dante):**  
- **Motif**:  
  - **Beat 1**: F (long, sustained, with a slight vibrato)  
  - **Beat 2**: G♭ (short, sharp)  
  - **Beat 3**: E♭ (long, with a crescendo)  
  - **Beat 4**: Rest  
- Let the note hang. Don’t resolve the G♭. Make it feel like a question, like a memory waiting to be understood.

**Bar 3 (Bass – Marcus):**  
- **Walking line in Fm**:  
  - **Beat 1**: C  
  - **Beat 2**: B♭ (chromatic approach)  
  - **Beat 3**: A♭  
  - **Beat 4**: G♭  
- Keep it moving, but now with a slight push forward—like it’s listening for the sax to answer.

**Bar 3 (Piano – Diane):**  
- **Comping on 2 and 4**:  
  - **Beat 2**: E♭7 (E♭, G, B♭, D)  
  - **Beat 4**: D7 (D, F♯, A, C)  
- Left hand: Chromatic line continues, driving up toward the tension.  
- Right hand: Play a suspended 9th chord on beat 2, then a diminished chord on beat 4—no resolution, just tension.

**Bar 3 (Sax – Dante):**  
- **Motif (continuation)**:  
  - **Beat 1**: F (long, held)  
  - **Beat 2**: E♭ (short, sharp)  
  - **Beat 3**: F (soft, almost a whisper)  
  - **Beat 4**: Rest  
- Let the saxophone feel like it's reaching for something not quite there. A memory, a dream, a feeling.

**Bar 4 (Bass – Marcus):**  
- **Walking line in Fm**:  
  - **Beat 1**: G♭  
  - **Beat 2**: A♭ (chromatic approach)  
  - **Beat 3**: B♭  
  - **Beat 4**: C  
- Now the line feels like it’s resolving, but not quite. It’s about to break.

**Bar 4 (Piano – Diane):**  
- **Comping on 2 and 4**:  
  - **Beat 2**: C7 (C, E, G, B)  
  - **Beat 4**: B♭7 (B♭, D, F, A♭)  
- Left hand: Chromatic line peaks on beat 4, then falls away.  
- Right hand: A diminished chord on beat 4—no resolution, just release.

**Bar 4 (Sax – Dante):**  
- **Motif (resolution)**:  
  - **Beat 1**: F (long, sustained, with a slight crescendo)  
  - **Beat 2**: G♭ (short, sharp)  
  - **Beat 3**: F (soft, with a fading vibrato)  
  - **Beat 4**: Rest  
- Make it feel like the question was answered, but not fully. It lingers. It hums. It’s the moment Wayne Shorter leans in.

**Final Note (Bar 4):**  
- **Drums**: A soft ride cymbal hit on beat 4, like a breath.  
- **Everyone holds the last note of the saxophone for a moment.**  
- The room is still. The question has been asked.  
- Wayne Shorter smiles.  
- Then the music continues.

**Key**: F minor  
**Tempo**: 160 BPM  
**Mood**: Suspense, yearning, memory  
**Story**: A question left hanging in the air, waiting for the next bar.
