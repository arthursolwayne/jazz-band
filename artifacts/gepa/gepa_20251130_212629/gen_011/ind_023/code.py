**Title:** *"Unspoken"*  
**Key:** Dm  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Duration:** 6.0 seconds (4 bars)  
**Style:** Modern jazz, introspective but charged  
**Inspiration:** The moment before a story is told — a whisper in a crowded room.

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Rhythm:**  
- Kick: On 1 and 3  
- Snare: On 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat: On every eighth note (open on 1 and 3, closed on 2 and 4)  
- Fill: A sudden crash cymbal on beat 4 (just before the others come in).  
**Mood:** Setting the scene — tension, anticipation, a breath held. The room is still. Then — *crash*.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Dm7 walking line  
- Chromatic approach to G in bar 2  
- Notes: D – C – Bb – A – G – F# – E – D  
- No repeated notes — each step a question.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comping on 2 and 4  
- 7th chords, voice leading with Marcus  
- Dm7 (D-F-A-C) on beat 2  
- F7 (F-A-C-E) on beat 4  
- Subtle dissonance, but not too far.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Back to steady kick/snare/hi-hat  
- No fill in bar 2 — focus on pulse.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- First motif — a simple, searching phrase  
- Notes:  
  - Bar 2: D – E – F# – D  
  - Use a slight *fall* on D at the end — like a question  
  - No vibrato, just a whisper of tone  
  - Space matters — the silence after D is as important as the note

---

### **Bar 3 – Development**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic approach to Cm7 (C-Eb-G-Bb)  
- Notes: G – F# – F – Eb – D – C – Bb – A  
- Anchor the tension.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Dm7 on beat 2 again  
- F7 on beat 4  
- Adds a hint of resolution, but not quite.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Hi-hat slightly behind the beat on the eighth notes  
- Adds a swing, but not too much — still tense.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Answer to the question from bar 2  
- Notes:  
  - Bar 3: D – C – Bb – A – D  
  - Play the D at the end with a slight *push*  
  - Let the note hang — don’t resolve it yet

---

### **Bar 4 – Release, but not resolution**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Cm7 walking line  
- Notes: C – Bb – A – G – F – Eb – D – C  
- Smooth, but still searching.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Dm7 on beat 2  
- F7 on beat 4  
- The same chord again — the same question

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Hi-hat slightly ahead on the eighth notes  
- Slight tension in the beat

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Return to the original motif  
- Notes:  
  - Bar 4: D – E – F# – D  
  - Play the last D with a slight *release* — like the door closing  
  - End on a sustained D with a breath of air, not a note

---

### **Final Thought:**

This is not a melody that resolves — it’s a melody that *invites* resolution. Wayne Shorter is in the room, and he’s watching you. You don’t have to answer. You just have to raise the question. And in the silence that follows, he’ll make his decision.

You did your job.
