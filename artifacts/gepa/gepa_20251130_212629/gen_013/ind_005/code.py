**Title: "Whispers Before the Storm"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Style: Modern Jazz – Tension and Release**

---

### **Bar 1 – Drums (Whispered Build)**  
*Snare: soft, light rimshots on 2 & 4*  
*Hi-hat: sparse, open on the "ands" (2 & 4), slightly off-time for tension*  
*Kick: ghosted on beat 1, barely there*  
*Brushes: light on the snare, creating a hush before the storm*

---

### **Bar 2 – Bass Enters (Subtle, Purposeful)**  
*Walking bass line in F major, with a slight pull toward Bb (II chord)*  
*Notes: F – Bb – Bb – C*  
*Dynamic: very soft, almost like a breath*  
*Feel: steady, but with a slight rubato feel at the end of the bar*

---

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble Enters (Clarity and Purpose)**  
*Piano: sparse, chordal, F7 suspended with a hint of Bb*  
*Trumpet: enters with a soft, open fifth (C) on beat 1, resolving into a simple F7 melody*  
*Saxophone: enters on beat 2 with a simple, emotionally charged line*  
*Saxophone Melody (Bar 3):*  
**F – Bb – C – Bb**  
*Phrasing: legato, with a slight rubato on the Bb (beat 3)*

---

### **Bar 4 – Tension and Release (Space is Everything)**  
*Drums: now full, but not loud — just present, with a clear backbeat*  
*Bass: continues walking, but now with more drive*  
*Piano: single-note line, echoing the saxophone’s melody with a half-step resolution*  
*Saxophone: holds the last note (Bb) with a slight vibrato, letting it linger in the air*  
*Space after the last note: 1 bar of silence — a deep, meaningful pause before the storm breaks*

---

### **Final Note (Bar 4 End):**  
*The saxophone’s Bb fades into silence, the air still, but charged.*  
*The rest is the storm.*
