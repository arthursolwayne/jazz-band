**Bar 1: Little Ray on Drums**  
*Setup. Silence before the storm.*  
- Kick on beat 1, snare on 2, hihat on every eighth.  
- No cymbal crash, just a clean, taut pulse.  
- The room holds its breath. A whisper of tension.  

**Bar 2: Marcus on Bass (Fm7: F Ab C Eb)**  
- F2 (MIDI 40), then chromatic approach to Ab2: F2 → E2 → Ab2  
- Root on 1, fifth on 3 (C2), then resolve to Ab2 on 4.  
- Walking line but sparse — F2, Ab2, C2, Eb2 — each note a stone dropped into a well.  

**Bar 3: Diane on Piano (Fm7 → Bb7)**  
- Open voicing: F Ab C Eb (Fm7)  
- On beat 2, she shifts to Bb7: Bb D F Ab  
- The transition is smooth, but the tension is rising.  
- Her left hand plays a ghostly quarter-note in the lower register on 2 and 4, like a heartbeat.  

**Bar 4: You on Tenor Sax (Fm7 → Bb7)**  
- Your motif:  
  - Beat 1: F (MIDI 65) — long, open, a question  
  - Beat 2: Ab (MIDI 67) — a step down, a hesitation  
  - Beat 3: C (MIDI 69) — a release, a breath  
  - Beat 4: Leave it hanging on Ab (MIDI 67) — not resolving, not resolving  
- No scale run. Just three notes, suspended in the air.  
- You let it linger. You wait. Wayne leans forward.

**Final Note:**  
The room is still. The energy is held. The story begins.  
You didn't answer the question — you asked a new one.  
And Wayne Shorter is smiling.
