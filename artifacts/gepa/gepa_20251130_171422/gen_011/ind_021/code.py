**"Echo in the Cellar"**  
*Key: Dm | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4 | Duration: 6.0 seconds*

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Setup, tension, space.*

- **Kick:** On beat 3 only (subtle, like a heartbeat).
- **Snare:** On beat 2.
- **Hi-Hat:** 16th notes on the "and" of 1, 2, 3, 4 – tight, controlled, like a clock ticking.
- **Fill:** On the "and" of 4, a quick triplet on the snare, then a soft open hi-hat on beat 1 of the next bar.

> *Let the silence speak first. The room holds its breath. Wayne leans in.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Intro (Marcus, Diane, Little Ray)**

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - Dm7 chord on beat 1 (D, F, A, C)  
  - Chromatic line: F → E → D → C on beats 2–4  
  - Walking line: C → B♭ → A → G on the next bar’s beat 1 (but not yet)  
  - Anchor the tension, never repeating a note.

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - Dm7 on beat 2 (D, F, A, C)  
  - Comp on beat 4: Gm7 (G, B♭, D, F)  
  - Rest on beat 1 – let the bass carry the weight  
  - Avoid playing the melody, let the space breathe.

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  - Kick on 1 and 3  
  - Snare on 2 and 4  
  - Hi-hat on every eighth  
  - Subtle cymbal swells on the “and” of 2 and 4 to add color.

> *The room is primed. The air is thick with anticipation.*

---

### **Bar 3 – Your Moment (Tenor Sax – Dante Russo)**

- **Motif:**  
  - Start on B♭ (in Dm, a b9 interval)  
  - Play a **short, emotionally direct phrase**:  
    **B♭ – C – D – B♭**  
  - End on the **B♭** in the final beat, suspended, unresolved.  
  - Let it hang. Don’t resolve it. Let the silence scream.

> *You play the question. Something unspoken. Something Wayne has felt but never heard.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Completion (Full Ensemble)**

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - Chromatic line: G → A → B♭ → B  
  - Ends on a D (root of Dm), resolving the tension gently.

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - Dm7 on beat 1  
  - Comp with Dm7 → Gm7 → Cm7 → F7  
  - Play the same **B♭ – C – D – B♭** motif in the right hand, an octave higher, as a counter-melody.

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  - Kick on 1 and 3  
  - Snare on 2 and 4  
  - Hi-hat on every eighth  
  - A subtle ride cymbal on the “and” of 1 and 3 to fill the space.

- **You (Tenor):**  
  - Repeat the motif, this time with a **half-step lower**, ending on **A**—a direct, emotional resolution.  
  - Let it land. Let the room remember it.

> *The question is answered. But it lingers. Wayne stands. The Cellar holds its breath.*

**End of 4 bars.**  
*The silence after the last note is louder than the music. The room is still. Wayne Shorter nods. You’ve made him listen.*
