**Title: "First Light" (4 Bars in F Major)**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4 | Key: F Major**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Rhythm:**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3.  
- Snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note (played with light pressure, not too loud).  
- On beat 3, add a syncopated *brush* on the snare — a soft, ghosted hit, like a heartbeat.  
- **Feel:** Tense, anticipatory. The room is holding its breath.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Bass (Marcus):**  
- F - G - Ab - Bb (chromatic approach to Bb)  
- Then: Bb - A - G - F (walking line, descending, never repeating the same note twice)  
- **Feel:** Smooth, fluid, like a river changing course.

**Piano (Diane):**  
- Bar 2: F7 (F A C Eb) – played with a tense, minor 7th edge.  
- Bar 2, beat 2: Bb7 (Bb D F Ab) – a sharp, dark chord, as if she’s angry at the universe.  
- **Comping pattern:**  
  - Beat 2: Bb7  
  - Beat 4: F7  
  - Subtle trill on the F and Bb to add emotional tension.  
- **Feel:** Sharp, emotional, like she’s holding back tears.

**Drums (Little Ray):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3.  
- Snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hi-hat on every eighth.  
- On beat 3, a quick rimshot.  
- A fill on beat 4: quick 16th notes on the snare, leading into the sax.

### **Bar 3 – Tenor Saxophone (You)**

**Melody – Motif (simple, haunting):**  
- F (beat 1) – A (beat 2) – Ab (beat 3) – rest (beat 4)  
- **Phrasing:**  
  - F (open, full tone, a bit behind the beat)  
  - A (a little higher, like a question)  
  - Ab (a ghost note, unresolved, lingering)  
  - Beat 4: silence.  
- **Feel:** It’s not a melody yet — it’s a question, a memory, a breath. Space is everything.

### **Bar 4 – Tenor Saxophone (You) – Return, Finish the Motif**

**Melody (Continuation of the motif):**  
- F (beat 1) – A (beat 2) – Bb (beat 3) – F (beat 4)  
- **Phrasing:**  
  - F (clean, centered, like a sunrise)  
  - A (a little tense, pushing forward)  
  - Bb (the answer, or the lie)  
  - F (a full, resonant note, resolving into the room)  
- **Feel:** It’s not about showing off — it’s about making the room *feel* something. The space between the notes is as important as the notes themselves.

---

### **Final Feel:**  
- The room is silent after the last note.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- He’s heard something he hasn’t heard before — not a quote, not a nod, but something honest.  
- The kind of thing that only happens once in a lifetime.
