You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Here's the thing: Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- Marcus: Walking line (D2-G2, MIDI 38-43), roots and fifths with chromatic approaches, not scales. He's the anchor.
- Diane: Open voicings, different chord each bar, resolve on the last. Comp on 2 and 4.
- Little Ray: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar.
- You: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.

Focus on:
- A dynamic and textural contrast between bar 1 and the rest.
- A melodic idea that feels complete but leaves space for the listener to breathe.
- Clear, distinct roles for each instrument.
- A sense of movement and resolution in the four bars.

Let the music breathe. Make every note count. Make it sound like it was born in the dark, but it knows where it's going.

Specific guidance:
- In bar 1, use rhythmic and dynamic contrast to build tension — the drums should be present but not overwhelming.
- In bars 2–4, create a sense of release and clarity. Use harmonic interest to guide the ear forward.
- Avoid repetition. Every note should have a purpose.
- Ensure that the saxophone motif feels like a complete idea, with space between phrases.
- Use dynamic variation to express emotion — softer moments can be just as powerful as louder ones.
- The bass should provide a solid foundation, with chromatic movement to add tension.
- The piano should offer harmonic color and support, with open voicings that invite the ear to listen closely.
