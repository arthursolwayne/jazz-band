---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Create tension and space. A slow build, like a door opening.*  
- **Kick:** On beat 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On beat 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (subtle, open, with a breathy edge)  
- **Fill:** A brief, open-ended cymbal swell on the last eighth of the bar, fading out into silence  

> *Let the room hold its breath. The silence is part of the intro.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano) – Comp on 2 and 4**  
*7th chords, spaced out, with a touch of chromatic tension.*  
- **Beat 2:**  
  - **Dm7** (D F A C) – played with a slightly dissonant voicing: **F A C D** (rootless, with a low F)  
- **Beat 4:**  
  - **G7sus4** (G C D F) – resolves upward, creating tension before resolution  
  - Played with a sharp, angular attack, like a question mark  

> *She’s not just comping – she’s framing the space where your melody will live.*

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line**  
*Chromatic lead-ins, never repeating a note. A slow motion journey.*  
- **Beat 1:** D  
- **Beat 2:** C# (chromatic approach to D)  
- **Beat 3:** D  
- **Beat 4:** C (chromatic approach to D)  

> *He’s the anchor, but he’s also the guide. Leading you where you want to go.*

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax) – Melody**  
*One short, haunting motif. A question. A whisper. A memory walking through the door.*  
- **Beat 1:** **F#** – a high, searching note, held with breath  
- **Beat 2:** **E** – a half-step down, lingering  
- **Beat 3:** **F#** – return, but softer, like a memory  
- **Beat 4:** **D** – resolve on the tonic, but not with certainty – leave it hanging  

> *It’s not a resolution. It’s a beginning. And Wayne Shorter knows it.*

---

### **Final Note (Bar 4, Beat 4)**  
- End on **D**, but let your breath trail off — like the last note of a question.  
- No dramatic flourish. Just a breath, and the room holds still.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.

**That’s it — four bars.**  
**The question is in the air.**  
**He’s listening.**  
**Now you play the answer in the next chorus.**
