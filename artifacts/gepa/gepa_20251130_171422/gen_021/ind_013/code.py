---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** 1, 3  
**Snare:** 2, 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Fills:** A subtle, ghosted ride cymbal on the "and" of 2 and 4

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
Fm7 (F Ab C Eb)  
Walking line:  
F → Gb → Ab → A → Bb → B → C → Db → Eb  
(Chromatic approach to A, then resolving down to Eb)

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4  
Chords:  
**2:** F7 (F A C Eb)  
**4:** Ab7 (Ab C Eb Gb)  
Voicings are sharp, dissonant, with a touch of tension in the left hand (rootless, but with a hint of Fm in the right)

**You (Tenor Sax – Motif):**  
*Note: All notes are played with a slight breathy, legato tone, as if the sax is whispering the first line of a forgotten song.*

**Melody:**  
**Bar 2:**  
F – (space) – Gb – (space)  
**Bar 3:**  
Ab – (space) – A – (space)  
**Bar 4:**  
Bb – (space) – B – (space)  
**Bar 4 (last note):**  
C – (space) – (space) – (space)  
(End on a held C, with a slight vibrato, like the last word of a memory slipping away)

---

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
Continues walking line  
B → C → Db → Eb → F → Gb → Ab → A  
(Chromatic approach to A again, but this time with more urgency)

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4  
**2:** Bb7 (Bb D F Ab)  
**4:** Cm7 (C Eb G Bb)  
Voicings are darker, more introspective. The left hand adds a ghostly interval beneath the right.

**You (Tenor Sax – Motif):**  
*Same note duration (half note with space in between) as in Bar 2*  
**Bar 3:**  
Ab – (space) – A – (space)  
**Bar 4:**  
Bb – (space) – B – (space)  
**Bar 4 (last note):**  
C – (space) – (space) – (space)  
(End with the same C as before, but this time it’s a whisper, not a question)

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
Continues walking line  
A → Bb → B → C → Db → Eb → F → Gb  
(Chromatic approach to Gb, resolving down to F)

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4  
**2:** D7 (D F# A C)  
**4:** Eb7 (Eb G Bb Db)  
Voicings are tense, but now with a glimmer of resolution in the left hand.

**You (Tenor Sax – Motif):**  
**Bar 4:**  
Bb – (space) – B – (space)  
**Bar 4 (last note):**  
C – (space) – (space) – (space)  
(You hold that C a little longer, as if it’s the last word in a sentence you’re not allowed to finish)

### **Final Note: Silence**  
After the final note is played, all instruments fall silent for a beat or two.  
The room is still.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He’s heard the question.  
He’s waiting to see if you have the answer.

### **End of Intro**  
You’ve set the stage.  
Now, the real music begins.
