**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 4 bars (6 seconds)**  
**Mood: Tense, searching, with a whisper of memory**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Snare on 2 & 4, kick on 1 & 3, hihat on every eighth. But hold back on the last eighth of the bar. Let the tension build with silence.*  
**Kick:** 1 — 3  
**Snare:** 2 — 4  
**Hi-hat:** & 1 — & 2 — & 3 — & 4  
*...then a rest at the end of the bar. A question left unanswered.*

---

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line in F major, with chromatic approach to G. Start on E, walk up to F, with a half-step chromatic leading into G on beat 3.*  
**Notes:** E — F — F# — G  
*On beat 3, pull back slightly, creating a tiny hesitation—like a memory surfacing.*

---

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp on 2 and 4 with 7th chords. F7 on 2, A7 on 4. Keep it sparse, let the space speak.*  
**Chords:**  
- Beat 2: F7 (F A C E)  
- Beat 4: A7 (A C# E G)  
*Play only the root, third, fifth, and seventh—no extensions. Let the dissonance linger.*

---

**Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Same pattern as before, but now with a slight fill on the “& of 4” that hints at a resolution that never comes.*  
**Kick:** 1 — 3  
**Snare:** 2 — 4  
**Hi-hat:** & 1 — & 2 — & 3 — & 4  
*Fill: Brushed snare on & of 4, just a tap, like a heartbeat.*

---

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Continuing the walking line, now with a chromatic approach to Bb. A shift in mood—something darker, unresolved.*  
**Notes:** G — A — A# — Bb  
*Play the A# with a little rub, like a question mark.*

---

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp with a Bb7 on beat 2, but leave the root out. Just the 3rd (D), 7th (F), and 9th (G). A suggestion of a key shift.*  
**Chord:** Bb7 (D F G) on beat 2.  
*Leave the rest of the bar open, letting the silence speak.*

---

**Bar 3 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Same pattern. But now the hihat is just a ghost on the & of 1. A ghost of a memory, maybe.*  
**Kick:** 1 — 3  
**Snare:** 2 — 4  
**Hi-hat:** (ghost) & 1 — & 2 — & 3 — & 4

---

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Your moment. A single motif. Start it, leave it hanging. Make it sing.*  
**Phrase:**  
- Beat 1: E (quarter note) — a high, yearning note.  
- Beat 2: Rest  
- Beat 3: G (eighth note)  
- Beat 4: Bb (eighth note) — resolved, but not fully.  
*Let the note hang. Let it breathe. Let it be the question that Wayne Shorter is waiting to answer.*

**Total Duration: 6 seconds.**

**What just happened?**  
You started with silence. You built tension with space. You hinted at a key shift but never landed. You left the question in the air—something unresolved, something searching. Wayne Shorter leans forward. He knows.  

This is the moment.
