Create an intro that feels like a whisper before a storm, with tension and release. The drums should build anticipation, then the ensemble enters with clarity and purpose. The saxophone melody should be simple but emotionally charged — something that lingers in the air. Every note should feel intentional, every rest meaningful. No unnecessary repetition. Keep the rhythm tight, the harmony honest, and the space between the notes alive. The melody should begin with a short, unresolved motif that invites curiosity and leaves room for interpretation. Let the bass lay a walking line with chromatic tension, and the piano should comp with 7th chords, driving the harmony forward without overpowering the space. The drums must fill the bar with energy but never drown out the voice of the sax. This is a moment of truth — make it memorable.
