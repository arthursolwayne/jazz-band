**D2 – E2 – F#2 – G2 – A2 – B2 – C#3 – D3**

**Bar 2 (beat 2):** Dmaj7 (D-F#-A-C#)  
**Bar 2 (beat 4):** D7 (D-F#-A-C)  
> *She leads with color, not volume. The chords are open and wide, like the space between notes.*

**Little Ray – Continues with same groove, same hihat.**  
> *He’s the pulse, the heartbeat of the room.*

**You (Tenor Sax) – Enter with Motif (Melody):**  
**Bar 2 (beat 2):**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
**D2 – E2 – F#2 – G2 – A2 – B2 – C#3 – D3**  
> *Same walking line. He doesn’t repeat, but he doesn’t change. He’s the anchor.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
**Bar 3 (beat 2):** Dm7 (D-F-A-C)  
**Bar 3 (beat 4):** D7 (D-F#-A-C)  
> *A shift in color, a hint of tension. She’s not hiding it — she’s pushing it.*

**Little Ray – Same groove, same energy, but now with a fill on beat 3:**  
> *A quick roll on the snare, a brush of hihat, and he’s back on the beat.*

**You (Tenor Sax) – Continue Motif (Melody):**  
**Bar 3 (beat 2):**  
- A4 (quarter note, staccato)  
- F#4 (eighth note, legato)  
- D4 (eighth note, legato)  
> *The answer is almost there — but not yet. It's a call, not a resolution.*

### **Bar 4: Full Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
**D2 – E2 – F#2 – G2 – A2 – B2 – C#3 – D3**  
> *Same line. Same path. He never wavers.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
**Bar 4 (beat 2):** Dmaj7 (D-F#-A-C#)  
**Bar 4 (beat 4):** D (root only, D2, sustained)  
> *She resolves — just a bit — but it’s not sweet. It’s sharp. It’s the kind of resolution that makes you lean in.*

**Little Ray – Same groove, same energy, but now with a final fill on beat 4:**  
> *He ends the bar with a flourish, a snare roll, and the hihat fading out.*

**You (Tenor Sax) – Final Note (Melody):**  
**Bar 4 (beat 4):**  
- D5 (half note, held, soft, fading)  
> *The question ends with a whisper. Not a resolution — but a promise.*

**End of 4 Bars.**  
The room is still.  
Wayne Shorter raises his glass.  
You don’t look at him.  
You just play.
