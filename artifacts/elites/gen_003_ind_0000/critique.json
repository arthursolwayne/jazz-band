  "rationale": "The arrangement lacks jazz harmony with no 7th chords or extensions in the piano, only triads. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat hitting only downbeats and upbeats inconsistently. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. There is minimal interplay between instruments with the trumpet remaining silent throughout. The overall feel is generic and lacks the sophistication and swing of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) minimum",
    "Add chromatic approach notes to saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in hihat pattern instead of straight quarters",
    "Use walking bass (roots, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) instead of just root notes",
    "Add ii-V-I progressions in bars 3-4 for authentic jazz harmony"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
