**"Mystery in F" — 4 Bars at 160 BPM, Key of F, 4/4 Time**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Quiet, mysterious, with space between hits.*  
- **Kick**: On beat 1 only (not 3).  
- **Snare**: Beat 2.  
- **Hi-hat**: On the "and" of 1, "and" of 2, "and" of 3, "and" of 4 — but very soft, almost like breath.  
- **Fill**: Halfway through bar (at "and" of 2), a soft brush stroke on the snare, like a whisper.  
- **Space**: The rest of the bar is empty. Let it hang.  

> *This is the question. A heartbeat, then silence. The audience leans in.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Everyone Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic walk up from F to A, then down to F.  
- Notes: F – Gb – G – A – Ab – G – F  
- Dynamics: Starts very soft, crescendos slightly.  
- Feel: An anchor, but not too heavy — like a shadow moving.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4.  
- Chords:  
  - Beat 2: F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
  - Beat 4: Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)  
- Play with tension — use a slight rubato on the Gm7, like she’s questioning something.  
- Left hand: Walking bass line in the background, but not too loud.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Enter with a single, sustained note: **Bb**, held on beat 1.  
- Then, on beat 2, a short, whispered **E** (half note, but played as a grace note).  
- **Dynamic**: Very soft, like a breath.  
- **Phrasing**: The **E** is a question. The **Bb** is a memory.

> *The tension builds. The room feels charged. Wayne Shorter is listening.*

### **Bar 3 – Development**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic walk down from F to D.  
- Notes: F – Eb – D – C – Bb – A – G – F  
- Dynamics: Same as before, but with a slight rubato on the A and G.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4 again.  
- Chords:  
  - Beat 2: F7  
  - Beat 4: Am7 (A, C, E, G)  
- Left hand: Light, walking line.  
- Right hand: A little chromatic passing tone on the Am7 — maybe a **Bb** or **G** to give it color.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Play a short motif: **Bb – E – D – Bb**  
- First note: Bb (beat 1)  
- Second note: E (beat 2)  
- Third note: D (beat 3)  
- Fourth note: Bb (beat 4)  
- **Dynamics**: Start soft, crescendo on the **E** and **D**, then fade out on the final Bb.  
- **Phrasing**: The **E** is the answer, the **D** is the doubt, and the **Bb** brings it back to the question.

> *The glimmer of resolution—then the search begins again.*

### **Bar 4 – Resolution? Or a New Question?**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic walk up again, but this time ends on a **Bb**.  
- Notes: F – Gb – G – A – Ab – G – F – Bb  
- Dynamics: Slight crescendo at the end.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4 again.  
- Chords:  
  - Beat 2: F7  
  - Beat 4: Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
- Right hand: A quick **F** on beat 1, then a **Bb** on beat 2 — like a nod to the saxophone.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3.  
- Snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hi-hat: On every eighth, but now with more energy.  
- Fill: At the end of the bar, a quick **snare roll** on the last eighth of beat 4.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Play a single, sustained **Bb** on beat 1.  
- Then, a very soft **E** on beat 2.  
- Let it hang — no resolution, just the question again.  
- **Dynamic**: Same as in Bar 2, but with a little more weight.  
- **Phrasing**: Let the silence after the **E** speak.

> *The room holds its breath. The story is not over. It's just beginning.*

### **Final Note:**
- The **Bb** is the memory.  
- The **E** is the question.  
- The space after is the answer Wayne Shorter is looking for.  
- No scale runs. No showmanship.  
- Just a story. One that wants to be heard.
