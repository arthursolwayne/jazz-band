### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Energy:** Tight, urgent, but with space.  
- Kick: On 1 and 3.  
- Snare: On 2 and 4.  
- Hi-hat: On every 8th note, but with a slight lift on 3 and 7.  
- Fill: A quick 8th-note triplet on the "and" of 4, then silence.  

**Purpose:** Build tension. Let the room hold its breath.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**  

#### **Marcus (Bass):**  
- D2 (MIDI 38) – Root  
- F2 (MIDI 41) – 5th  
- A2 (MIDI 45) – Root again  
- C2 (MIDI 36) – Minor 7th (chromatic approach from D)  

**Pattern:** D – F – A – C  
**Rhythm:** Walking, even eighth notes.  

#### **Diane (Piano):**  
- Bar 2: Open voicing: **Fmaj7 (F-A-C-E)** – Dissonant but rich  
- Bar 3: **G7sus4 (G-C-D-F)** – Suspended, unresolved  
- Bar 4: **Dm7 (D-F-A-C)** – Resolve on the last beat  

**Comping:** On beats 2 and 4 only.  

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:**  
  - **Bar 2:** Dm (D-F-A) – short phrase, ascending  
    - D (beat 1), F (beat 2), A (beat 3), open on beat 4  
  - **Bar 3:** Ghosted, low Bb (beat 1), then A (beat 2), G (beat 3) – descending, questioning  
  - **Bar 4:** Return to D (beat 1), F (beat 2) – incomplete, unresolved  

**Phrasing:** One musical idea, broken into fragments, like a sentence left hanging. No scales, just tension and space.  

---

### **Bar 4 – Resolve (or not)**  
- Diane ends on Dm7, but holds the chord for a half-beat longer.  
- Marcus walks up to a Bb (MIDI 46) on beat 4 – a b7, hinting at a key change or a bluesy twist.  
- Little Ray holds the hihat on 3 and 7, then ends with a snare roll on 4.  
- Dante leaves the last note of the motif unresolved – a D, held for a beat, then silence.  

---

### **Final Feel:**  
- Urgent but unresolved.  
- Like the first sentence of a story you’re not ready to tell.  
- You’re not showing off – you're inviting him in.
