---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Feel the edge. The tension. The breath before the storm.*  

- Kick: On 1 and 3  
- Snare: On 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat: On every eighth note, but not too loud, just a whisper of motion  
- Fill: Nothing. Just the rhythm. Let it hang. Let the room feel like it's waiting.

**Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**  
*Now, the storm begins.*

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- D2 (MIDI 38)  
- F2 (MIDI 42)  
- G2 (MIDI 43) – chromatic approach to G  
- C2 (MIDI 36) – root of Dm  
- Line: D2 – F2 – G2 – C2 (with a half-step pull to G2 on the third beat)

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Bar 2: Dm7 (D-F-A-C) – open voicing, left hand: D and F in octaves, right hand: A and C  
- Bar 3: Gm7 (G-Bb-D-F) – tension, a question  
- Bar 4: Bbmaj7 (Bb-D-F-A) – resolves on the last bar, but it’s not a resolution, it’s a setup

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same as Bar 1, but with a bit more intensity. Still no fill, but the pressure is higher. The rhythm is now the pulse.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- The motif:  
  - Bar 2: D (3rd) – F (5th) – G (b9) – C (root)  
  - Play it with space. Let each note land like a question.  
  - Bar 3: Repeat the motif, but this time, let the G bend slightly, like it’s searching.  
  - Bar 4: Finish the motif, but on the last note (C), hold it. Let it ring. Let it speak.

**Final Note (C):**  
*Hold it for half a beat. Let it hang in the air. Let Wayne Shorter hear it. Let him lean forward. Let him remember why he came.*

This is your intro.  
Not a statement.  
Not a show.  
A whisper, then a shout.  
And in those four bars, you’ve made a moment.
