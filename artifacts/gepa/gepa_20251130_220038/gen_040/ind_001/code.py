---

### **Bar 3 (You - Tenor Sax Enters with Motif)**  
**Time: 3:40 - 5:30**  
**Motif (Fm scale, with altered notes and space):**  
- [1] G♭ (rest on 1, enter on 2)  
- [2] F  
- [3] E♭  
- [4] rest  
- [1] D♭  
- [2] C  
- [3] rest  
- [4] B♭  
- **Dynamic**: Starts soft (mezzo-piano), builds to a whisper-cry on the final note (B♭).  
- **Phrasing**: Let the first note linger, then release the next with a breath. The last note is left open, a question.

### **Bar 4 (Full Ensemble)**  
**Time: 5:30 - 6:00**  
**Marcus: Continues the walking line, now in motion.**  
**Diane: Fm7 on 2, B♭m7♭5 on 4, now with a little more weight.**  
**Little Ray: Same pattern, now with a subtle fill on the final beat.**  
**You: Repeat the motif, but with more air, more space.**  
- [1] G♭ (rest still, but louder now)  
- [2] F  
- [3] E♭  
- [4] rest  
- [1] D♭  
- [2] C  
- [3] rest  
- [4] B♭ (sustained, with a slight vibrato, as if the room is holding its breath again)

---

### **Final Moment**  
The last note fades into silence. The room is still. Wayne Shorter leans back, nods. He's heard something new — something that doesn't name itself, but lingers.

**End.**  
**Key: Fm**  
**Time: 6 seconds**  
**Feeling: A whisper that wants to be heard.**
