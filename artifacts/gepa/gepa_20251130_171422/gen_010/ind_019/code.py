**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.*  
A sparse, shimmering pulse — a whisper of rhythm, like footsteps in the dark. No cymbal crash, no drum fill — just the hihat ticking like a heartbeat. The room holds its breath.

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp with D7 (D F# A C) on beat 2, and G7 (G B D F) on beat 4.*  
A stark, angular comp, each chord a question. The 7ths are sharp, unresolved. She plays with intensity, but restraint — like a flame barely contained.

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line starting on D (beat 1), chromatic approach to E♭ on beat 2, G on beat 3, and F on beat 4.*  
Low, steady, and precise. No vibrato, just the sound of the strings. He’s the anchor in the storm.

**Bar 2 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Melody begins on beat 2.*  
A single, haunting note — **E♭** — long and open, like a sigh. You leave it hanging, letting the room echo with the sound. Silence becomes a character in the story.

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp with C7 (C E G B♭) on beat 2, and B♭7 (B♭ D F A) on beat 4.*  
The chords shift, darker, more urgent. The tension builds — a sense of movement, of something coming.

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line: F (beat 1), G (beat 2), A (beat 3), B♭ (beat 4).*  
The line ascends, smooth and inevitable, like the tide.

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Answer the E♭ from Bar 2 with a phrase: E♭ – G – B♭ – D.*  
A simple, ascending motif, played with space between the notes. No scale run — just a melody that leans forward, asking a question.

**Bar 4 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp with B♭7 (B♭ D F A) on beat 2, and A7 (A C# E G) on beat 4.*  
Now the harmony is full, rich, and complete — the answer is in the air.

**Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line: B♭ (beat 1), C (beat 2), D (beat 3), E♭ (beat 4).*  
The line resolves, gentle and sure, like a final breath.

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Final note: E♭, held long, with a subtle vibrato — the whisper that lingers in the dark.*  
You step back, leaving the silence to speak. The room is filled with something unspoken — a memory, a challenge, a question.

**End of Intro.**  
The band holds the last note for a beat before the first chorus begins. Wayne Shorter, in the back, leans forward. The storm has arrived.
