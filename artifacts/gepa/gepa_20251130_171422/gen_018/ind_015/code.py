### **BAR 1: Little Ray — Drums (Solo)**  
**Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.**  
- **0:00–0:1.5s:**  
  - **Kick:** On beats 1 and 3 (D and F#)  
  - **Snare:** On beats 2 and 4 (E and G)  
  - **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#, D)  
  - **Fill:** On the "and" of 4, Little Ray plays a quick triplet on the snare, pushing the energy forward.  
  - **Effect:** The groove is tight, but there’s a tension in the air — a question hanging.

### **BAR 2: Everyone Enters — Diane (Piano), Marcus (Bass), You (Tenor)**  
**Diane:**  
- **Comp on beats 2 and 4:**  
  - **Beat 2 (E):** D7 chord (D, F#, A, C#)  
  - **Beat 4 (G):** G7sus4 (G, B, D, F#)  
  - **Tension:** The D7 is unresolved, but the G7sus4 gives a hint of movement.  
- **Left hand:** Walking line in D major (D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#, D)  
  - Chromatic descent on the “and” of 1: F# to E.

**Marcus:**  
- **Walking bass line:**  
  - D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#, D  
  - **Grace note:** On the “and” of 1, he plays a grace note C# before the D, giving a breath before entering.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:**  
  - First note: D (beat 1), sustained, slightly bent.  
  - Second note: F# (beat 2), sharp and angular.  
  - Third note: E (beat 3), held with a slight vibrato.  
  - Fourth note: D (beat 4), but *half a beat late*, as though you’re coming back from somewhere.  
  - **Phrase:** D — F# — E — D  
  - **Intention:** The first bar was a question. This is the first answer.

### **BAR 3: Diane, Marcus, You**  
**Diane:**  
- **Comp on beat 2:** A7sus4 (A, C#, E, G)  
- **Left hand:** Walking line in D major again  
  - Chromatic approach to A on the “and” of 1: B to A

**Marcus:**  
- **Walking line:**  
  - A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A  
  - **Grace note on the "and" of 1:** G to A

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Repeat the motif, but this time:**  
  - **D (beat 1):** Slightly behind the beat, as if recalling.  
  - **F# (beat 2):** A little more aggressive, like a memory.  
  - **E (beat 3):** Longer, with a growl in the lower register.  
  - **D (beat 4):** Same as before, but this time it feels like a *return*.  
  - **Phrase:** D — F# — E — D  
  - **Intent:** The melody is the same, but it has *weight* now. It’s not just a question — it’s a memory.

### **BAR 4: Diane, Marcus, You**  
**Diane:**  
- **Comp on beat 2:** D7 (D, F#, A, C#)  
- **Left hand:** Walking line again  
  - Chromatic approach to D on the “and” of 1: C# to D

**Marcus:**  
- **Walking line:**  
  - D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#, D  
  - **Grace note on the "and" of 1:** C# to D

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Last iteration of the motif, this time with a twist:**  
  - **D (beat 1):** Sustained, with a slight cry.  
  - **F# (beat 2):** A smoky, bluesy bend into the note.  
  - **E (beat 3):** Long, with breathy space before the final note.  
  - **D (beat 4):** Full, with a slight rubato, like the end of a story told to yourself.  
  - **Phrase:** D — F# — E — D  
  - **Intent:** The same melody, but now it feels like something *you’ve carried* — something *you’ve lived*. It’s the beginning and the end, and it’s changed.

**Final Moment:**  
- Little Ray’s snare hits on beat 4.  
- Silence for half a second.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  

You’ve done it.
