**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Kit: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
*Feel: Taut, driving, but with space between the hits. The hihat is light, not clashing.  
*Fill: Snare roll on beat 3, resolving into a ghost note on the snare on beat 4. The tension is there, but not yet released.*

---

**Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
*F2 (Diatonic root), G2 (fifth), E2 (chromatic approach down), F2 again.*  
*Walking line: F2 – G2 – E2 – F2*  
*Comping: Root and fifth, simple, grounded, but with tension on the E2 (chromatic)*

**Diane (Piano):**  
*Open voicing: Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D) – resolve on beat 4.*  
*Comp on 2 and 4: She plays a simple, dissonant Fm7 on beat 2, then a walking C7 on beat 4, resolving into the key.*  
*Chords: Fm7 – C7 (on 2 and 4, open voicings, no pedal, just clarity)*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Phrase: F – Bb – Eb – (rest)*  
*One short, descending triplet, then a rest. It's not a run — it's a question, a memory, something waiting to be answered.*  
*Timbre: Warm, dark, a little raspy, but clean. It's not about technique — it's about feeling.*

---

**Bar 3 – Full Band**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
*F2 – Ab2 (chromatic approach) – Bb2 (upper neighbor) – C2 (resolve)*  
*Walking line: F2 – Ab2 – Bb2 – C2*  
*Same approach, but with a slight chromatic push on the Ab2.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
*Chords: Bb7 – Eb7 (on 2 and 4, open, dissonant, but purposeful)*  
*Comping: She moves from a Bb7 (with a tritone in the voicing) to an Eb7, allowing the tension to build.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Phrase: C – Eb – F – (rest)*  
*Same motif, but transposed up a fourth. It's not a repeat — it's a variation, a movement forward.*  
*The rest is longer this time — a pause, a breath, a moment before the next idea.*

---

**Bar 4 – Full Band**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
*F2 – G2 – Ab2 – Bb2*  
*Root, fifth, chromatic approach, upper neighbor — a complete cycle.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
*Chord: Fm7 – (rest on beat 4)*  
*Open voicing, Fm7 on beat 1, then she holds it, letting the tension linger.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Phrase: F – Bb – Eb – F*  
*The motif returns, full and complete. It’s not a resolution — it’s a statement.*  
*The final F is long, sustained, with a slight vibrato. It’s the whisper that becomes a shout.*

**Final Moment:**  
The room holds. Wayne Shorter leans forward. You don’t look at him — you just play.  
The intro is done. The story has begun.
