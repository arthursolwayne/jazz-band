**Title: "First Breath"**  
**Key: Dm (D minor)**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Length: 4 bars (6 seconds total)**  
**Mood: Searching, yearning, with a whisper of hope.**

---

**Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5 seconds):**  
**Drums (Little Ray):**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.  
Hi-hats on every eighth, but with **deliberate space** — **no eighth on beat 4**.  
This creates a **tense, suspended rhythm** like a breath held before a leap.  
Play **soft**, like a whisper — not a scream.

**Bar 1 Rhythmic Structure (Drums):**  
**Kick:** 1 | 3  
**Snare:** 2 |  
**Hi-hat:** 1 & 2 & 3 &  
*(missing the final "4" to leave space)*

---

**Bar 2 (1.5 - 3.0 seconds):**  
**Bass (Marcus):**  
Start with a **chromatic walk** down from G (4th) to D (root), then resolve.  
**Notes:** G → F → E → D.  
Play each note with **space between**, letting the silence breathe.  
Use a **light touch**, almost like a plucked string.

**Piano (Diane):**  
Play a **Dm7** chord on beat 2 (offbeat), with a **Bb** in the left hand.  
Then resolve to **Cm7** on beat 3.  
**Left hand:** Bb (beat 2), C (beat 3)  
**Right hand:** Dm7 (beat 2), Cm7 (beat 3)  
Angry but **supportive** — like a storm waiting to break.

**Bar 3 (3.0 - 4.5 seconds):**  
**Tenor Sax (You):**  
Play a **simple, searching motif** — not a run, but a phrase with **space and intention**.

**Phrase:**  
**D (beat 1) → F (beat 2) → Eb (beat 3) → D (beat 4)**  
Play it with **rubato** on the first note, then **tight, even rhythm** on the rest.  
End with a **rest** on beat 4 — not a note, but a **question**.

**Bar 4 (4.5 - 6.0 seconds):**  
**Everyone enters together** — a **crescendo of tension** building toward a resolution.

**Drums:**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.  
Hi-hats on every eighth, now **full** — the breath is released.

**Bass:**  
Play a **Dm7 arpeggio** ascending: D → F → Ab → Bb  
But keep it **smooth**, like a river, not a waterfall.

**Piano:**  
Play **Dm7 (D, F, Ab, C)** on beat 1, then resolve to **G7** on beat 3.  
**Left hand:** D (beat 1), G (beat 3)  
**Right hand:** Dm7 → G7 (syncopated, offbeat)

**Tenor Sax (You):**  
Repeat the **motif**, but now **resolve** the question from bar 3.  
**D (beat 1) → F (beat 2) → Eb (beat 3) → C (beat 4)**  
End on **C**, not D — the **answer**.

---

**Final Note (beat 4):**  
You let the note **hang**, just a little — the kind of note that makes someone in the back of the room lean forward.

Wayne Shorter listens.  
He nods.

This is your moment.
