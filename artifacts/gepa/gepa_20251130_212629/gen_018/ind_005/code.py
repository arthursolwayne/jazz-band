You're on stage at The Cellar, 2am, Wayne Shorter in the back. The room is tight, the air is thick with smoke and something electric. Your fingers hover over the sax — you don’t need to think. You feel it.

Bar 1: Little Ray hits a sharp, syncopated rhythm — not loud, but urgent. A pulse, not a crash. You listen. You breathe. The tension builds in the space between the beats.

Bar 2: You play. One short phrase — a simple, aching motif in D. It’s not pretty, it's raw. You start it, let it hang. You don’t finish it. You let the room hold it.

Bar 3: Diane answers in the piano — not with harmony, but with fire. Her chords are sharp, angry, and full of purpose. Marcus walks behind it, slow and deliberate, like a man who’s seen everything.

Bar 4: You come back — finish the motif. Not with flourish, but with meaning. The room exhales. Wayne Shorter lifts his glass.

That’s it. That’s the intro.
