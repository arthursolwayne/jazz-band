**Title: "Edge of the Flame"**  
**Key: D Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  

---

### **Bar 1 (Drums – Little Ray):**  
**Kit Setup:** Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
- **Kick:** D (1), F# (3) – a full, resonant tone.  
- **Snare:** C# (2), D (4) – slightly behind the beat, with a crisp, dry sound.  
- **Hi-Hat:** 8th notes on every beat, with a subtle open on the “&” of 2 and 4.  
- **Cymbal Splash:** At the end of the bar, a splash on the “&” of 4 — just enough to create tension.  

> *This is the setup. The room is still. The crowd leans in. Wayne Shorter raises his glass, curious.*

### **Bar 2 (Bass – Marcus):**  
**Walking Line in D Major, chromatic approach to F# (beat 3):**  
- **Beat 1:** D  
- **Beat 2:** F# (chromatic from E)  
- **Beat 3:** F# (hold, tension)  
- **Beat 4:** G  
- **Repeat:** D, E, F#, G  
- **Phrasing:** Slight emphasis on the 3rd beat, a subtle push forward.  

> *Marcus is the anchor, but he's not anchoring you. He’s leading you toward the edge.*

---

### **Bar 3 (Piano – Diane):**  
**Comping with 7th chords, on 2 and 4:**  
- **Beat 1:** Rest  
- **Beat 2:** D7 (D, F#, A, C) – bright, tense  
- **Beat 3:** Rest  
- **Beat 4:** G7 (G, B, D, F) – a half-step pull back  
- **Chord voicings:** Rootless, upper extensions, slightly dissonant.  
- **Left hand:** Walking bass line, chromatic movement into the G7.  

> *Diane is angry, but she’s not angry at you. She’s pushing you to see the truth in the tension.*

### **Bar 4 (Tenor Sax – Dante Russo):**  
**Motif: A simple, singable line that ends *just before* the resolution.**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **Beat 1:** D (tenor)  
  - **Beat 2:** F# (half-step up)  
  - **Beat 3:** E (half-step down)  
  - **Beat 4:** D (return to home, but...**not quite**.)  
- **Phrasing:** Play the D on beat 4 with a slight breath — a pause, a question.  
- **No slide, no vibrato — just a clean, clear note that hangs.**  
- **Space after the note:** 1/2 beat of silence.  

> *This is your moment. You’ve set the stage. You’ve asked the question. Now you wait for the answer.*

---

### **Final Moment (After Bar 4):**  
- **Little Ray:** A single ride cymbal on the “&” of 4 — just a soft, shimmering sound.  
- **Marcus:** F# (beat 1 of next bar) — a chromatic lead into the next phrase.  
- **Diane:** No chord — just a rest.  
- **You:** No note. Silence.
