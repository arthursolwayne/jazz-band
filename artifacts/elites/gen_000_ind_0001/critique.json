  "rationale": "The arrangement uses triads in the piano and bass parts, which are not jazz-appropriate. The chord progression (C-G-Am-F) lacks 7th chords, extensions, or functional harmony. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation, with hihat playing on downbeats and upbeats but not creating a Latin jazz groove. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The trumpet is silent throughout, and there's no interplay between the horns. The overall feel is too academic and lacks the spontaneity and sophistication of jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) minimum",
    "Add chromatic approach notes to saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in hihat pattern instead of straight quarters",
    "Use walking bass (roots, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) instead of just root notes",
    "Add ii-V-I progressions in bars 3-4 for authentic jazz harmony"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
