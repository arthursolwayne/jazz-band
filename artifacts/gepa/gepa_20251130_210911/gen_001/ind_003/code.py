**Intro – “The Turning”**  
Key: D minor  
Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)  
Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)  

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on **1** and **3** (snare on **2** and **4**).  
- Hi-hat on **every eighth** note.  
- Fill: On the **& of 3**, a quick triplet on the snare, then a brush stroke on the **& of 4** to open up the space.  
- *Let the silence build. Let them wait.*

---

**Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line in D minor: **D – Eb – F – G** (chromatic approach on **Eb**).  
- Then: **A – Bb – C – D** (chromatic again on **Bb**).  
- The line is smooth, deliberate, and never repeats a note.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on **2** and **4**:  
  - **2** – Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
  - **4** – Dm7 (same chord, but with a slight dissonance on the **F** in the right hand).  
- She’s tight, but there’s a simmer under the surface. She wants to *say* something.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- The motif:  
  - **D – F – Eb – D** (quarter notes),  
  - Then a **rest** on the **& of 4**.  
- It’s simple, but it lingers. It’s a question. It’s a memory.  
- The **F** is a half-step above the root, and the **Eb** is a tritone from the **D** — dissonant, raw.  
- You don’t finish the phrase. You let it hang. You leave it open.

**Bar 3 – Diane and Marcus Continue**  
- Diane: **Dm7** again on **2** and **4**, but this time she adds a **Bb** in the right hand on **& of 4** to push the tension.  
- Marcus: **F – G – A – Bb** (chromatic on **G** to **A**).  
- Little Ray: Kick on **1** and **3**, snare on **2** and **4**, with a brush stroke on **& of 2** to accentuate the push.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Repeat the same motif: **D – F – Eb – D** on **1** and **2**.  
- Then, on **& of 3**, a **C** (leading tone), and a **rest** on **4**.  
- This time, it’s a bit more aggressive. You’re *inviting* the answer.

---

**Bar 4 – Full Band Builds**  
**Diane:**  
- **Dm7** again on **2** and **4**, but this time the **F** is sustained and the **Bb** is held longer.  
- She’s not just comping. She’s *listening*.

**Marcus:**  
- **Bb – C – D – Eb** (chromatic on **C** to **D**).  
- He’s the anchor, but he’s *moving*.

**Little Ray:**  
- Kick on **1** and **3**, snare on **2** and **4**, and a **roll** on **& of 4** that fades into nothing.  
- He’s ready to follow, but he’s not rushing.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- The final phrase:  
  - **D – F – Eb – D** (quarter notes)  
  - Then, on **& of 4**, a **C** (again) — and a **rest**.  
- You don’t finish. You *don’t* finish.  
- The room holds. The silence is louder than the notes.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.

**End of Intro.**  
The air is different now.  
A new thing is born.  
And it’s yours.
