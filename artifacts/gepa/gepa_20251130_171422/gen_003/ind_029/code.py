**Dante Russo — “Four Bars for a Ghost”**  
*Key: F Major | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4 | Duration: 6.0 seconds*

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit:**  
- **Kick:** on 1 and 3 (full, deep, punchy).  
- **Snare:** on 2 and 4 (crisp, bright, with a slight “snap” on beat 4).  
- **Hi-Hat:** on every eighth note (steady, but not too loud — just a whisper of rhythm).  
- **Fill:** On beat 3, a **cymbal crash** (hi-hat or ride — not too big, just a whisper of drama).  
- **Spaces:** **Rest on beat 2** — let the tension build before the release.

**Mood:** Suspense. A question in the air. The room holds its breath.

---

### **Bar 2 – Everyone In**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Roots:** F, G, Ab, Bb (walking line, chromatic approach to G).  
- **Approach:** On beat 3, a **chromatic run** (F–F#–G) leading into the G.  
- **Rhythm:** Even eighth notes, with a subtle **swing feel**, never repeating the same note.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chords:**  
  - **Bar 2, beat 1:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
  - **Bar 2, beat 2:** G7 (G, B, D, F)  
  - **Bar 2, beat 3:** Ab7 (Ab, C, Db, Eb)  
  - **Bar 2, beat 4:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
- **Comping:** On **2 and 4** only — sparse, but **assertive**. Each chord lands with purpose.  
- **Left hand:** Walking bass line (same as Marcus’ line, but in the left hand).

**You (Sax):**  
- **Motif (Bar 2, beat 1):**  
  - Play a **short, ascending triplet** on **F–G–Ab**.  
  - **End on Ab**, letting it hang in the air for a moment.  
  - **Silence beats 2–3 on the sax** — let the tension build in the space.  
  - **Return on beat 4** with a **repetition of the F–G–Ab motif**, but **lowered by a half-step** (E–F–G).  
  - End that on **G**, **holding** it — a question without an answer.

**Mood:** Urgency. A call. Something unresolved, but full of promise.

---

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Line:** F–G–Ab–Bb–C–D–Eb–F (chromatic and diatonic mix, with a Bb on beat 3 as a chromatic approach to C).  
- **Feel:** Smooth, deliberate, like the walk of a man who’s seen things.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chords:**  
  - **Bar 3, beat 1:** C7 (C, E, G, Bb)  
  - **Bar 3, beat 2:** D7 (D, F#, A, C)  
  - **Bar 3, beat 3:** Eb7 (Eb, G, Bb, D)  
  - **Bar 3, beat 4:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
- **Comping:** Again, on **2 and 4** — sharp, cutting through the mix.  
- **Left hand:** Walking line, same as Marcus.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick:** 1 and 3.  
- **Snare:** 2 and 4.  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth.  
- **Fill:** On beat 3, a **light cymbal swish** — not overwhelming, just enough to push the energy forward.

**You (Sax):**  
- **Motif (Bar 3, beat 1):**  
  - Repeat the **F–G–Ab** motif again.  
  - This time, **end on Ab** but **glissando down to F**, like a sigh.  
  - Let the **last note linger** for a beat before the next bar.

**Mood:** Yearning. A memory. Something almost heard.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble (Climax)**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Line:** F–G–A–Bb–C–D–Eb–F (chromatic leading into A, then resolving down).  
- **Beat 3:** Chromatic approach to A (Gb–G–A).

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chords:**  
  - **Bar 4, beat 1:** A7 (A, C#, E, G)  
  - **Bar 4, beat 2:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
  - **Bar 4, beat 3:** B7 (B, D#, F#, A)  
  - **Bar 4, beat 4:** C7 (C, E, G, Bb)  
- **Comping:** On 2 and 4, with a **slight crescendo** on beat 4.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick:** 1 and 3.  
- **Snare:** 2 and 4.  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth.  
- **Fill:** On beat 3, a **light rim shot** — almost imperceptible, but enough to signal the end.

**You (Sax):**  
- **Motif (Bar 4, beat 1):**  
  - Repeat **F–G–Ab** again.  
  - This time, **end on Ab** but **glissando down to F**, like a sigh.  
  - Let the final note **hang for a full beat**, then **fade** into silence.

**Mood:** Resolution. Not a full one, but enough to suggest a path forward. A question turned into a beginning.

### **Final Note:**
You stop. The room breathes. Wayne Shorter looks up.  
The intro is done.  
The music has begun.

**That’s your shot, Dante.**  
Now go play it.
