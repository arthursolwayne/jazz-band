---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**

**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hihat:** On every eighth note  
**Fill:** A single open hi-hat on the “&” of 3 — just before the hit.  
**Feel:** Tight, driving, like a door about to crack.

---

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano) enters on beat 2**  
**Comping:**  
- **Beat 2:** C7 (C-E-G-Bb)  
- **Beat 4:** D7 (D-F#-A-C)  
- **Rest on 1 and 3**  
**Voice Leading:** Upward motion, chromatic tension.  
**Mood:** She’s not here to support — she’s here to question.

---

### **Bar 2: Marcus (Bass) enters on beat 2**  
**Walking Line (starting on beat 2):**  
- **Beat 2:** F (root)  
- **Beat 3:** G# (chromatic approach to A)  
- **Beat 4:** A (tension)  
- **Beat 1 (next bar):** Bb (chromatic descent back to F)  
**Feel:** Subtle, grounding, but restless.

---

### **Bar 3: Dante (Tenor Sax) enters on beat 2**  
**Melody (starting on beat 2):**  
- **Beat 2:** F (sax enters with a low, breathy F, held for 2 beats)  
- **Beat 3:** G# (chromatic lift, tension)  
- **Beat 4:** A (sustained, unresolved)  
- **Beat 1 (Bar 4):** Silence — a rest — then a final F on the “&” of 1  
**Phrasing:** Long, open, whispering. Let it hang. Let it breathe.

---

### **Bar 4: Full ensemble**  
- **Marcus:** Continues walking line (Bb -> C -> D -> Eb)  
- **Diane:** Comp again on 2 and 4:  
  - **2:** B7 (B-D#-F#-A)  
  - **4:** C7 (C-E-G-Bb)  
- **Little Ray:** Full kit, driving, but not overpowering.  
- **Dante:** One final note — **F**, played with a slight vibrato, like a sigh — and then silence.

---

### **Final Moment:**

- The last note fades into the concrete, the air thick with possibility.  
- Wayne Shorter leans in.  
- He’s heard something that doesn’t fit the map, something that might rewrite it.

**End of Intro.**  
**The door is open.**
