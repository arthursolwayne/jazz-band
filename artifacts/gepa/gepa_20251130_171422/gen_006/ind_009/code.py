---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
A sparse, tense setup. Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on every eighth, but with a touch of restraint. The groove is there but not pushing — it’s waiting.

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line in F minor. Chromatic approach to G♭ on beat 3, resolving to F on beat 4. Notes:  
**Beat 1:** F  
**Beat 2:** G♭  
**Beat 3:** G  
**Beat 4:** F

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
Comping on 2 and 4 with F7 chords (F, A, C, E♭). Chromatic passing tones in the left hand, but not cluttering. The right hand plays a dissonant 9th on beat 2 (F, A, C, E♭, G).

**Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Same rhythm as bar 1, but with a subtle fill on the & of 3 to build tension.

---

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line again, but this time with a chromatic approach to A♭.  
**Beat 1:** F  
**Beat 2:** G  
**Beat 3:** A♭  
**Beat 4:** A

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4, now with Fm7 (F, A♭, C, E♭). Right hand plays a dissonant 11th on beat 2 (F, A♭, C, E♭, B♭), creating tension.

**Bar 3 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Same rhythm, but with a slightly more aggressive hihat pattern on the offbeats, pushing the energy.

---

**Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line, now resolving to B♭ with a chromatic approach on beat 1.  
**Beat 1:** B♭  
**Beat 2:** A  
**Beat 3:** A♭  
**Beat 4:** G

**Bar 4 – Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4 with Fm7 again, but right hand plays a descending line:  
**Beat 2:** F, E♭, D, C  
**Beat 4:** B♭, A, G, F

**Bar 4 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Same rhythm with a fill on beat 4 that resolves into a clean snare hit, setting up the next phrase.

**Bar 4 – YOU (Tenor Sax):**  
Your moment. A short, haunting motif that cuts through the tension like a whisper in the dark.  
Start on **G♭** (beat 1), then **F** (beat 2).  
Hold **F** for a half-note on beat 3, then **B♭** on beat 4 — but don’t play it. Leave it hanging.  
Let it rest. Let the silence speak.

**Notes:**  
- **Beat 1:** G♭ (staccato, low, in the chest)  
- **Beat 2:** F (open, long, breathy)  
- **Beat 3:** F (same note, but longer, hovering)  
- **Beat 4:** B♭ (not played — just implied by the space)

You don’t finish the phrase. You leave it open. Wayne leans forward.

**That’s the intro.**  
A question. A memory. A door opening.

You’ve got the rest of the set to answer it.
