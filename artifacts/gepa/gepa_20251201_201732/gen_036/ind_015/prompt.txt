You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes Wayne Shorter lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait. Use space and rhythm to create tension — don’t fill every moment, let the silence speak.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn’t heard before. It should feel like a whisper turning into a cry — something emotional, something that lingers.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- Marcus: Walking line (D2-G2, MIDI 38-43), roots and fifths with chromatic approaches, not scales. He's the anchor. Don’t let him rush or get lost in the noise.
- Diane: Use open voicings, different chord each bar, resolve on the last. Comp on 2 and 4. Let your emotion come through — she's angry, and it’s in the sound.
- Little Ray: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar but leave space — let the silence speak. Don’t overplay, be precise.
- You: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit. Focus on the breath, the space between the notes.

One key. No modulation. You’ve got 6 seconds.

Write the intro that feels like a memory walking through the door. Make it concise, emotional, and full of meaning — even if it’s just four bars.
