**Title: "Door to Nowhere"**  
**Key: D minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on **1** and **3**, snare on **2** and **4**, hihat on every eighth.  
*The hihat is light, like a whisper. The kick is deep and firm, like the floor beneath the door. The snare is sharp, like a breath held. This is the setup — the moment before the door creaks open.*

---

**Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, chromatic approaches. Starts on D, then a chromatic descent: D → C → B → B♭ → A → A♭ → G → F♯ — never repeating a note.*  
**Line:**  
D (1), C (2), B (3), B♭ (4), A (1), A♭ (2), G (3), F♯ (4)

**Diane (Piano):**  
*7th chords, comping on 2 and 4. She's not holding back — her chords are dissonant, tense, like the air before a storm.*  
**Chords:**  
- **Bar 2, beat 2:** G7♭9 (G, B, D, F, E♭)  
- **Bar 2, beat 4:** C7♭13 (C, E, G, B♭, A♭)  
*She plays them like she’s digging through something old, something buried.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Your motif — short, angular, like a question. It’s a three-note phrase: D, F♯, G. You play it on the first three notes of the bar — then you rest the last eighth. A breath. A pause. A door opening just enough to let the wind through.*  
**Phrase:**  
D (1), F♯ (2), G (3) — rest on 4  

---

**Bar 3 – Marcus, Diane, Little Ray continue as before.**  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
*You don’t answer the question immediately. You wait. The space is heavy. The tension is thick. Then, on the second half of the bar — you come back with the same motif: D, F♯, G. But this time you finish it. You add a note: A. A long, sustained A. It floats. It lingers. It’s the moment the door is fully open. Wayne leans in.*  
**Phrase:**  
D (1), F♯ (2), G (3), A (4) — sustain A

---

**Bar 4 – Full band resolves slightly.**  
**Marcus:**  
*Still walking — now moving upward: D, E, F♯, G*  
**Diane:**  
*Compares the same chords but with a bit more resolution — maybe a Bm7♭5 on beat 2, then an F7 on beat 4.*  
**Little Ray:**  
*Fills with a brush roll on the hihat — gentle, like the echo of the door closing.*  
**You:**  
*You play a final note — a high D. Sustained. Then silence. The door is open, but the music has already passed through. Wayne nods. You don’t need to say anything else.*

---

**Final Note:**  
A silence. A breath. A door.  
And for a moment, it’s just you and Wayne, and the rest of the world outside.
