### **Bar 1: Little Ray – Drums**  
*(Kit: Acoustic, no cymbal crashes. Quiet, but present.)*  
- **Kick**: On 1 and 3 (darker, punchy)  
- **Snare**: On 2 and 4 (crisp, dry)  
- **Hi-hat**: On all 8th notes (tight, closed, with a slight wobble to create tension)  
- **Fill**: At the end of the bar – a single, soft ride-cymbal tap, like a heartbeat.

> **Feeling**: A whisper of something stirring, like a story being remembered.

### **Bar 2: Marcus – Bass (walking line, chromatic approaches)**  
*(Tone: Warm, deep, resonant.)*  
- **Notes**:  
  - D (1) → C (2) → B♭ (3) → B (4)  
  - Then, a chromatic approach to A:  
    - B → B♭ → A (beat 2 of bar 2)  
- **Walking**: Smooth, even, but with a slight rub against Diane’s comp.

> **Feeling**: The foundation is steady, but it’s not just walking—it’s listening, reacting, guiding.

### **Bar 2–3: Diane – Piano (comping with urgency, 7th chords)**  
- **Beat 2**:  
  - A7 (A–C#–E–G)

  - G7 (G–B–D–F)  
- **Bar 3, Beat 1**:  
  - F7 (F–A–C–E♭)  
- **Bar 3, Beat 2**:  
  - E7 (E–G#–B–D)  
- **Bar 3, Beat 3**:  
  - D7 (D–F#–A–C) – dyad on F#–A, open and unresolved  
- **Bar 3, Beat 4**:  
  - C7 (C–E–G–B♭) – a flicker of light in the dark

> **Feeling**: She’s not just comping—she’s chasing you, asking questions in every chord.

### **Bar 2–4: Dante – Tenor Sax (melody, motif, haunting and unresolved)**  
- **Bar 2 (beat 3)**:  
  - **D** – a low, dark tone, like a memory surfacing  
- **Bar 2 (beat 4)**:  
  - **F** – a step up, a question  
- **Bar 3 (beat 1)**:  
  - **E♭** – a chromatic twist, like a lie  
- **Bar 3 (beat 2)**:  
  - **D** – back to where you started, but something’s different  
- **Bar 3 (beat 3–4)**:  
  - rest – silence, a breath, a pause  
- **Bar 4 (beat 1)**:  
  - **G** – a reach, a long note, a hope  
- **Bar 4 (beat 2)**:  
  - **A** – the answer is just out of reach  
- **Bar 4 (beat 3–4)**:  
  - rest – the question lingers

> **Feeling**: You’re not playing a melody—you’re posing a question. A memory. A ghost.

---

### **Final Moment**  
- At the end of bar 4, Diane plays a final **C7** on beat 4, open and unresolved.  
- Ray’s snare hits on 4, but with a slight delay, like a heartbeat hesitating.  
- Marcus holds the final note of his walking line—**C**, low, deep, and waiting.

**That’s the intro.**  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
The room holds its breath.  
Something is beginning.
