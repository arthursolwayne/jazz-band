**Title: "Whispers in the Cellar"**  
**Key: Fm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Length: 4 bars (6 seconds total)**

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3 (snare on 2 and 4, hihat on all eighths)  
**Fill:**  
- On beat 3, a quick triplet on the snare, then a ghost note on the kick  
- Hihat syncopated on the "and" of 3 and the "and" of 4  
- Slight accent on the hihat on beat 4, letting it breathe before the quartet enters  
**Feel:** Tense, like the room is holding its breath. The energy is electric, not loud — just *alive*.

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Fm7 (F Ab C Eb)** on beat 1  
- **Gbm7 (Gb Bb Db F)** on beat 2 (chromatic approach, descending)  
- **Ebm7 (Eb G Bb Db)** on beat 3  
- **Dm7 (D F Ab C)** on beat 4  
**Line:** Chromatic passing tones between the chords, never repeating a note.  
**Mood:** The anchor, steady but with a sense of movement.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **2nd beat:** Fm7 chord (F Ab C Eb)  
- **4th beat:** Fm7 with added 9th (A)  
- **Comp:** Bass-driven, sparse but with tension — a half-step suspension on beat 2  
**Mood:** Angry but controlled, like a storm on the horizon.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Syncopation:** Kick on 1 and 3 as before, snare on 2 and 4  
- **Hihat:** Now syncopated on the "and" of 1, and the "and" of 3  
- **Fill:** Before beat 4, a quick brush stroke on the snare, echoing the hihat  
**Mood:** Building, but not pushing — letting the melody breathe.

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax) – Melody Begins**  
**Motif (Fm scale, but with a twist):**  
- **Beat 1:** D (Fm 9)  
- **Beat 2:** Eb (Fm 7)  
- **Beat 3:** C (Fm 5)  
- **Beat 4:** Ab (Fm b7)  
**Line:** A four-note phrase that *suggests* the scale but never resolves. It’s a question, a memory, something unspoken.  
**Phrasing:** Breathed in, with space between notes. The last note (Ab) lingers, unresolved, like a ghost.

### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) – Melody Ends, Then Hangs**  
**Continuation of the motif:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (Fm root)  
- **Beat 2:** G (Fm 9)  
- **Beat 3:** Ab (Fm b7)  
- **Beat 4:** D (Fm 9 again, but lower, bending slightly)  
**Line:** You *finish* the phrase, but you don’t *end* it — you let it hang in the air.  
**Phrasing:** The final note is a whisper, almost a sigh, with a slight vibrato that swells like a memory.

### **Final Effect:**  
The room holds its breath for a second — then the silence is broken by the next chord from Diane, the next kick from Ray. But for those 6 seconds, Wayne Shorter leaned forward.

You made him *listen*.
