**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Duration per bar:** 1.5 seconds  
**Total duration:** 6 seconds  

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Pattern:**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3 (snare on 2 and 4).  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note.  
- *No cymbal crash, no fill. Just a steady, taut pulse.*  
- A single open hi-hat on beat 3, slightly delayed, like a breath held.  
- *The room holds. The silence is heavy. You feel it in your ribs.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- D2 (F root)  
- F2 (chromatic approach up)  
- G2 (F5)  
- F2 (resolve)  
- *He plays the root, then a half-step above, then the fifth, then back to root — a question that doesn’t resolve, just lingers.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Chord:**  
- **Fmaj7 (F, A, C, E)**  
- *Open voicing, left hand on F and C, right hand on A and E. A warm but tense sound — like a memory you can almost touch.*  
- *She plays it on beat 2, not 1, letting the bass and drums set the stage. A subtle departure, a whisper in the dark.*

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- D2 (F root)  
- F2 (chromatic again)  
- G2 (F5)  
- F2  
- *Same as Bar 2, but with more urgency. The question is still unanswered, but the tension is building.*

---

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Chord:**  
- **F7 (F, A, C, E♭)**  
- *A dominant seventh — that same F, but now with a twist. The air gets thicker. The room leans in. She plays it on beat 3, a half-beat after the bass, like a thought that follows a question.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- D2 (F root)  
- F2  
- G2  
- F2  
- *Same line again, but this time, the timing is perfect. The rhythm is in place. The question has been asked three times, and now it’s about to be answered.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Chord:**  
- **Fmaj7 (F, A, C, E)**  
- *She resolves back to the major seventh, but the voicing is different — now a bit more open, a bit more hopeful. It’s the same chord, but the way she plays it feels like a door opening just a crack.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif:**  
- **F (beat 1) – A (beat 2) – C (beat 3) – F (beat 4)**  
- *Short, simple, but with space between each note. It’s not a scale, it’s a phrase — a sentence that ends with a question mark. You play it with a breathy, almost spoken tone, like a story you’re not sure you want to tell.*

- *You leave the last note hanging, a quarter note on beat 4, just enough time for Wayne Shorter to lean in.*

---

**End of Intro**  
- The room is still.  
- The whiskey glass is still.  
- But the question is out there.  
- And it’s yours.
