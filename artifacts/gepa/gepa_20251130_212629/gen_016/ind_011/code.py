---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit Setup:**  
- Kick on **beat 1** (strong, punchy, slightly behind the beat)  
- Kick on **beat 3** (same, but lighter, more ghosted)  
- Snare on **beat 2** (sharp, crisp, almost like a snap)  
- Snare on **beat 4** (same, but with a bit of accent)  
- Hi-hat on **every eighth note** (steady, precise, locking in time)  
- **No cymbal crashes, no fills – just tension, just time.**

  - **Beat 1:** C (b7)  
  - **Beat 2:** B (leading tone)  
  - **Beat 3:** A (5)  
  - **Beat 4:** D (root)

- Comp on **beat 2** and **beat 4**  
  - **Beat 2:** Dm7 (D F A C)  
  - **Beat 4:** Dm7 (D F A C), with a slight **F#** (raised 3rd) in the right hand – a **color note**, subtle but sharp  
- Left hand: Walking bass line matching Marcus (same as above), but with a **chromatic** twist on beat 4: **C# → D**

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same as Bar 1, but now with **slightly more energy** – the tension is building  
- **Hi-hat** stays locked, **kick/snares** now more dynamic, more aware of the sound

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif (Bar 2):**  
  - **Beat 1:** F (minor 3rd of Dm) – held for a full beat, **steady, soulful**  
  - **Beat 2:** Bb (chromatic descent, a half-step below B) – short, staccato  
  - **Beat 3:** C (b7) – a soft, open note, almost a question  
  - **Beat 4:** Rest  
- **Space is everything.** The rest on beat 4 is like a door left open.

  - **Beat 4:** D (root)

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 4:** Dm7 again, but now with a **Dm7#11** on beat 1 (D F A C E) – the **sharp 11th** creates a **modern, dissonant** sound  
- Right hand: **G**, a **outside note**, played **staccato**, like a flicker of doubt

**Little Ray (Drums):**

- The final note is **left hanging**, unresolved, full of **possibility**

### **Final Note:**
This is the **intro**. It’s not a statement — it’s a **setup**.  
It’s the **first light** before the storm.  
And in the back of the room, **Wayne Shorter** is leaning forward.
