Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.  
Hihat: open on beat 1, closed on 2, open on 3, closed on 4.

**Bar 2 (1.5 - 3.0s):**  
**Diane (Piano):**  
- Bar 2: Dm7 (D-F-A-C) – open voicing, root on the bottom, A on top.  
  *Play it with space. Let the chord ring, don’t overplay.*  
- Bar 3: Gm7 (G-Bb-D-F) – same voicing, resolved on beat 4.  
- Bar 4: Cm7 (C-Eb-G-Bb) – open, with a slight rub on the G.  
  *Each chord is a pivot, a step in the story.*

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Bar 2: D (root), F (chromatic approach), G (fifth), D again.  
- Bar 3: G, Bb, D, G.  
- Bar 4: C, Eb, G, C.  
*Walking line, with slight syncopation on the off-beats. Anchor but not rigid.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Bar 2: Same pattern, but hihat on beat 2 is softer.  
- Bar 3: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on all eighths, but quieter.  
- Bar 4: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on all eighths, louder.  
*Builds tension, sets the stage for the melody.*

**Bar 4 (3.0 - 4.5s):**  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Start on **C** (beat 1), then **Bb** (beat 2), **A** (beat 3), **G** (beat 4).  
*Play the first four notes of the motif – short, questioning, like a memory surfacing.*

Rest on beat 4.  
*Lay it out. Let the room process it. Let Wayne Shorter feel it.*

---

**Final Line (4.5 - 6.0s):**  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Repeat the motif – **C**, **Bb**, **A**, **G** – but this time, play it with a little more soul, a little more *truth*.  
*End on the G, but leave it hanging. Let it breathe. Let it be a question.*

---

**End of 4 bars.**  
*The room is still. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The story has begun.*
