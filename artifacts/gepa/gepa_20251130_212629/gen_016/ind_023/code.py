### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**

**Kick:** On beats 1 and 3.  
**Snare:** On beats 2 and 4.  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note.  
**Fill:** A bold, syncopated ride cymbal on the "and" of 3, just before the bass enters. The rhythm is tight, driving — like a heartbeat in a dark room.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**

**Walking line in D minor, chromatic approaches, never repeating a note:**

- **Beat 1:** D (open 5th)  
- **Beat 2:** C (chromatic up to D)  
- **Beat 3:** D# (chromatic up to E)  
- **Beat 4:** F (chord tone)  

**Subtle surprise:** On the "and" of 3, a quick pull-off to C# — a half-step below the D, like a shadow passing by.

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**

**Comping: 7th chords, on beats 2 and 4.**

- **Beat 2:** G7 (G B D F) — dominant 7, slightly altered to G7#9  
- **Beat 4:** Cm7 (C Eb G Bb) — a color that contrasts the D minor, like a memory in the dark  

**Left hand:** Walking triplets in the bass, a bit dissonant, pushing the rhythm forward.  
**Right hand:** Fast, angular runs in the upper register, like sparks in the dark.

### **Bar 2 – You (Tenor Sax)**

**Motif begins — short, haunting, and unresolved:**

- **Beat 1:** D (sustained, a half note)  
- **Beat 2:** G (short, like a whisper)  
- **Beat 3:** Bb (half-step below B, like a question)  
- **Beat 4:** Rest — silence  

**Phrasing:** The note on beat 1 is a cry, the G is a response, the Bb is the doubt, and the rest is the void. You hold the D, longer than it should be, and then you let it go.

---

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble**

**Marcus:** Continues the walking line — a chromatic descent from F to D.  
**Diane:** Comping again on beats 2 and 4:  
- **Beat 2:** A7 (A C# E G)  
- **Beat 4:** Dm7 (D F A C)  
**Little Ray:** Pulse is stronger now, cymbal on the "and" of 2, snare on 4, ride on the 3.  
**You:** Start the motif again — D on 1, G on 2, Bb on 3, and now you **play the rest** — a descending line back to the D, completing the circle.  

---

### **Bar 4 – Resolution and Release**

**Marcus:** Ends with a trill on D, played with the bow, a subtle nod to the past.  
**Diane:** Last chord is a Dm7 with a suspended 4th — D F A C — leaving the 4th hanging.  
**Little Ray:** Final fill — a choked cymbal, a snare ride, a hihat resolving on the last eighth.  
**You:** Final note — D, played with a breath, like a sigh. Then silence.

**Final Note:**  
The room holds. The air is thick. Wayne Shorter leans back, sips his whiskey, and smiles.  
You’ve told a story in four bars. And it’s the first time he’s heard it — but somehow, it’s the one he was waiting for.
