**Bar 1 (0.00–1.50s):**  
**Little Ray on Drums**  
Kick on beat 1 and 3. Snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on every eighth note. But here, it’s **deliberate** — the hihat is a whisper, not a crash. The snare is sharp, but with a rimshot edge. The kick is deep and low, like a heartbeat. It’s *quiet* energy. He holds the bar like a breath before a fall.

**Bar 2 (1.50–3.00s):**  
**Marcus on Bass (F2, Ab2, Bb2, D3 — MIDI 43, 45, 46, 48)**  
He starts with a root (F2), then a chromatic approach to Ab2 (F2–F#2–Ab2). Then he walks the fifth (C2), resolves with the Ab2 again. Then he moves up to Bb2 (chromatic approach to Bb), then D3 (fifth of Fm). The line is like a question — steady, grounded, but with a hint of something not quite resolved.

**Diane on Piano**  
She plays an open Fm7 voicing (F, Ab, C, D) on beat 2. Then, on beat 4, she shifts to a Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab) that resolves back to Fm. It’s a pivot, a color that hints at a key change that never happens. She plays it with fire, but it’s not anger — it’s tension. She’s *waiting*.

**Bar 3 (3.00–4.50s):**  
**Marcus on Bass (F2, Ab2, Bb2, C2 — MIDI 43, 45, 46, 48)**  
He walks with a chromatic approach again — F2 to F#2 to Ab2, then Bb2, then C2. It’s like a heartbeat, but with a little twist. His line is the ground, the truth, the memory of the song before the melody.

**Diane on Piano**  
She plays a G7 (G, B, D, F) on beat 2, then on beat 4, a Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb). It’s a false resolution. The G7 is sweet, but the Cm7 is dark. It’s like a door opening to a room you don’t want to go into.

**Bar 4 (4.50–6.00s):**  
**Marcus on Bass (F2, Ab2, Bb2, D3 — MIDI 43, 45, 46, 48)**  
Same line again, but with more weight. He’s grounding it now. He’s the anchor, but not the center. He’s the silence between notes.

**Diane on Piano**  
She resolves to Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D) on the last beat. It’s the same chord that started the piece, but now it *feels* different. Like a homecoming that wasn’t expected.

**Little Ray on Drums**  
He fills the bar again, but with more intensity. Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. But now, there’s a slight *swell* — like the room is holding its breath, waiting for your first note.

---

**Bar 4 (4.50–6.00s):**  
**You on Tenor Sax**  
You start with a single note — **Ab** (MIDI 70), long, held, and full. It’s not a note you expect in Fm, but it’s not out of place. It’s a question. Then a short, descending motif: **Ab – G – F – Eb**, but not played straight. You slide from Ab to G, then a sharp articulation on F, then a breath on Eb. You leave it hanging. It’s not a resolution — it’s a *call*.

You end on **Eb**, suspended in the air. The room holds. Wayne Shorter lifts his glass. He’s listening.

**The intro is complete.**  
Now, the song begins.
