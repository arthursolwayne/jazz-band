**Title: "Ghost in the Cellar"**  
**Key: D minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Length: 4 bars (6 seconds)**  

---

**Bar 1 (0:00–1.5s): Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Set the scene with tension and anticipation.*

- **Kick**: On beats 1 and 3 (D, F)  
- **Snare**: On 2 and 4 (G, Bb)  
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth note (starting on 1), using a brushed, dry sound  
- **Fill**: A short, syncopated cross-stick on the “& of 3” that cuts through the silence like a whisper in the dark  

**Mood**: Uneasy, building, like a door creaking open in the dark.

---

**Bar 2 (1.5–3.0s): Marcus (Bass) enters on beat 2**  
*Walking line in D minor, with chromatic approach to the 3rd (F) on beat 3.*

- **Notes**:  
  - Beat 2: F  
  - Beat 3: Eb (chromatic approach to F)  
  - Beat 4: G  
  - Beat 1 (next bar): A  
- **Rhythm**: Even, precise, never repeating the same note twice.

**Mood**: Anchor. Steady. Relentless.

**Bar 3 (3.0–4.5s): Diane (Piano) enters on beat 2**  
*Comping with Dm7 chords on 2 and 4, but with a twist — a Dm7#11 on beat 4 that colors the air.*

- **Beat 2**: Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
- **Beat 4**: Dm7#11 (D, F, A, C, F#) — the tritone in the chord adds a dark, unresolved tension  
- **Left hand**: Walking bass line, following Marcus but adding chromatic passing tones

**Mood**: Shadowy, emotional, reflective.

---

**Bar 4 (4.5–6.0s): You (Tenor Sax) enter on beat 3**  
*Your moment. A simple, haunting motif that ends on a suspended note — the last note is left hanging, but it’s complete.*

- **Phrase**:  
  - Beat 3: D (soprano register)  
  - Beat 4: F (chromatic run: D→Eb→F, but only play D and F)  
  - Beat 1 (next bar): Bb (in the upper register, half-step above A)  
  - Beat 2: C (returning to D minor, resolving slightly)  
  - *Then hold the C for the rest of the bar — silence the rest of the band, let it ring.*

**Mood**: Haunting, unresolved, but powerful. Like the ghost of a memory you never let go of.

**Final Note (at 6.0s):**  
You hold that C, and for a moment, the room is still. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The Cellar has never felt this big.
