**Title: "Wait for the Echo"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  
**Mood: Expectant. Tense. Barely there, but waiting for something to break.**

---

**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hihat on every eighth  
- **Subtle fill on beat 3** (brushed, soft, like a whisper in the dark)  
- **No cymbal crash** — just a heartbeat.

---

**Bar 2: Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line**  
- **F2 (MIDI 48)** – Root  
- **A2 (MIDI 51)** – Fifth  
- **G#2 (MIDI 50)** – Chromatic approach to A  
- **A2 (MIDI 51)** – Root again  
- **Repeat pattern**  
- **Dynamics**: Soft, almost like a sigh. No vibrato. Just pulse.

**Bar 2: Diane (Piano) – Open Voicings**  
- **Fmaj7 (F-A-C-E)** – Bar 2, beat 2  
- **Dm7 (D-F-A-C)** – Bar 2, beat 4  
- **Open voicing, no pedal, just clarity**  
- **Left hand**: Root and fifth  
- **Right hand**: 9th and 13th, spaced out  
- **Example**:  
  - F-A-C-E (no 7th)  
  - D-F-A-C (no 7th)  
- **Resolve on the last chord** (Dm7), but leave it unresolved.

---

**Bar 3: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- **Same pattern** as bar 1, but with a **slightly louder snare on beat 2**  
- **Hi-hat a bit brighter**, still 8th notes  
- **Feeling like the room is holding its breath**.

---

**Bar 3: Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line**  
- **F2 (MIDI 48)**  
- **A2 (MIDI 51)**  
- **G#2 (MIDI 50)**  
- **A2 (MIDI 51)**  
- **Repeat pattern**  
- **Same dynamics**, same feeling — steady, but waiting.

---

**Bar 3: Diane (Piano) – Open Voicings**  
- **Gm7 (G-Bb-D-F)** – Bar 3, beat 2  
- **C7 (C-E-G-Bb)** – Bar 3, beat 4  
- **Same technique**: left hand root and fifth, right hand 9th and 13th  
- **C7** is the first real tension — a question, but not answered.

---

**Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) – Melody**  
- **Motif**:  
  - **F (beat 1)** – Long, breathy, like a sigh  
  - **G (beat 2)** – Short, sharp, like a whisper  
  - **F (beat 3)** – Long again, but softer  
  - **G (beat 4)** – Holds, but doesn’t resolve  
- **Phrasing**:  
  - Start strong, hold the note, then **leave it hanging**  
  - Don’t finish the phrase — let the silence speak  
- **Dynamics**:  
  - **Mezzo-forte on F (beat 1)**  
  - **Piano on G (beat 2)**  
  - **Pianissimo on F (beat 3)**  
  - **Leave G (beat 4) unplayed, just breath**  
- **No vibrato** — just the tone of a man who knows something is coming.

**Final Moment (beat 4, end of bar):**  
- The room is quiet.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- The echo is in the air.  
- It's not the melody that caught him. It's the **space between**.

**That’s your intro.**  
**That’s the question.**  
**That’s what he’s waiting for.**
