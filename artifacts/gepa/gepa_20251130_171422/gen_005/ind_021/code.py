**Title: "First Light"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 4 bars (6 seconds)**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (tight, crisp, no splash)  
**Fill:** None — just the groove. Let the silence before the storm.

---

### **Bar 2 – Intro (Marcus, Diane, Little Ray):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
F – G♭ – G – A♭ (walking line, chromatic tension)  
F – G♭ – G – A♭ (repeat, but vary rhythm slightly on the second pass)  

**Diane (Piano):**  
F7 (F A C E) on beat 2  
F7 on beat 4  
Keep the chords open, no voicings that block the space. Let the bass outline the harmony.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every 8th. Tight, driving, no fills.

---

### **Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax) – Melodic Motif:**  
**Phrase (starting on beat 1):**  
F – A♭ – B♭ – C (upward, with a slight rubato feel)  
Hold the C, let it hang. No resolution — leave it open, like a question.  
This is your moment. Make it feel like the first time you ever played that note in front of someone who matters.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble, Return to Motif:**  
**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
Repeat the motif, but this time finish it:  
F – A♭ – B♭ – C – D♭ – C – B♭ – A♭  
End on A♭, a half-step below the original C — a haunting, unresolved close.

**Marcus (Bass):**  
F – G♭ – G – A♭ (same line as before, but now with more urgency)  

**Diane (Piano):**  
F7 on beat 2, F7 on beat 4 — same as before, but the tension feels heavier now.  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
Same groove, but maybe a little more aggression in the hihat, like the room is holding its breath.

**End of 4 bars.**  
You’ve set the tone. Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
You’ve opened a door.  
Now, let the music walk through.
