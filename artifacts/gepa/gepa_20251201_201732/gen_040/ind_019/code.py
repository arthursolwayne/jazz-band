**BAR 4 – DANTÉ RUSSO (TENOR SAX)**  
*Your moment. The whisper. The question.*

- **Motif (F major):**  
  - **MIDI Notes:**  
    - 1st beat: A (MIDI 69) – long, sustained, with a slight breath  
    - 2nd beat: C (MIDI 60) – short, staccato  
    - 3rd beat: Rest – silence  
    - 4th beat: F (MIDI 65) – long, lingering, like the last note of a memory  
- **Phrasing:**  
  - You don’t run. You *suggest*.  
  - The A is the question.  
  - The C is the answer.  
  - The rest is the silence between you and the audience.  
  - The F is the moment you hold, waiting for the room to breathe.

**END OF INTRO.**  
*The room is still. Wayne Shorter leans forward. Something just happened. You didn’t play a note he didn’t already know — but you made him hear it again.*
