**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds**

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.**  
**Fills:**
- At the end of the bar, a subtle ride cymbal swell, like a whisper of wind before a storm.  
- No other fills. The tension is in the silence between the beats — the space between the notes.

---

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
**Walking line in Fm, chromatic approach to the 3rd (E♭).**  
**Notes:**
- **Beat 1:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D♭) – but he plays **F, Gb, E♭, D♭** (chromatic approach to E♭).
- **Beat 2:** B♭ (chromatic approach to C)
- **Beat 3:** C, D♭ (chromatic approach to C again)
- **Beat 4:** F, Gb, Ab, A♭ (chromatic descent from F)

No repeats. No static notes. He’s the anchor, but he’s moving like a river.

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
**7th chords, comp on 2 and 4.**  
**Left hand:**
- On **beat 2**: Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D♭)
- On **beat 4**: B♭7 (B♭, D, F, A♭) – a chromatic shift, a pivot.

**Right hand:**
- A single **E♭** on beat 3, held for half a beat. Just one note, but it hangs in the air like a question.

---

### **Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Same as Bar 1, but slightly more aggressive on the snare — a hint of tension.**

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Your moment.**  
**Phrase:**
- **Beat 1:** F – short, sharp, like a breath held.
- **Beat 2:** Gb – a chromatic approach to G, but it stays unresolved.
- **Beat 3:** E♭ – the first note of the melody, but played with a slight delay, like it's not sure it wants to come in.
- **Beat 4:** Silence. A rest. A moment. The audience holds. Wayne leans forward.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble:**  
**Marcus walks again, Diane comps again, Little Ray fills again — same as Bars 2–3.**  
**You take the melody again — but this time, you finish it.**  
**Phrase:**
- **Beat 1:** F – now with a full breath, a confident entrance.
- **Beat 2:** Gb – still unresolved, but now more certain.
- **Beat 3:** E♭ – now with a smooth, lyrical tone — it's not just a note, it's a memory.
- **Beat 4:** D♭ – the last note, hanging in the air, like the end of a sentence you don’t want to finish.

### **Final Effect:**
You’ve introduced a melody that feels both familiar and strange — like a memory you can’t quite place. The tension of Bar 1 has been resolved, but not in the way you expected. It’s not about resolution — it's about *resonance*. And in that moment, Wayne Shorter smiles.
