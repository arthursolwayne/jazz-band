---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray – Drums (Solo, Setting the Scene)**

- **Kick**: On 1 and 3.  
- **Snare**: On 2 and 4.  
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth note.  
- **Fill**: A short, implied triplet before the downbeat — like a breath before the first note.  
- **Feel**: Tense but open, like a door creaking open. It’s not loud, but you *hear* it.

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters – Diane on Piano (Comping)**

- **Diane** plays a **Dm7 chord**, with a **chromatic approach** from C to D.  
- **Voicing**: Dm7 (F, A, C, D) – but with a **C# in the left hand**, approaching the D.  
- **Rhythm**: Comp on **2 and 4** — light, sparse, but **clear**. Let the space be felt.  
- **Dynamics**: Soft, but with **intention** — like the first footstep in a new room.

### **Bar 2: Marcus on Bass (Walking Line)**

- **Line**:  
  - D (1) → C (2) → Bb (3) → B (4)  
  - Chromatic descent from D to B, then a half-step up to B.  
- **Feel**: The bass line is **tense**, like a question hanging in the air. Always moving, never repeating a note.  
- **Dynamics**: Subtle, but **present** — the anchor.

---

### **Bar 2: Little Ray – Drums (Continuation)**

- **Kick**: On 1 and 3.  
- **Snare**: On 2 and 4.  
- **Hi-hat**: Eighth notes, but **slightly behind the beat**, giving it a **push** forward.  
- **Group feel**: The groove is **tight**, but not locked — it’s **alive**.

---

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax) – Melody Starts**

- **Note**: Play a **D** on beat 1.  
- **Then**: A **Bb** on beat 2.  
- **Then**: A **C** on beat 3.  
- **Then**: A **rest** on beat 4.  
- **Phrasing**: The **D** starts strong, the **Bb** leans in, the **C** answers, and the **rest** is the **question**.  
- **Feel**: It’s not a run. It’s a **statement** that ends with **silence**.  
- **Dynamics**: Soft, but with **weight** — like a whisper that carries.

---

### **Bar 4: Full Ensemble – Resolution and Lead-In**

- **Diane**:  
  - **Dm7 chord** again, but this time with a **C in the left hand**, resolving the chromatic tension.  
  - Still comping on 2 and 4, but now with **more space**.  
- **Marcus**:  
  - **F** on 1, **E** on 2, **Eb** on 3, **E** on 4 — a **chromatic lead** into the next phrase.  
  - The bass line is **resolving the question**, but not answering it yet.  
- **Little Ray**:  
  - **Kick on 1 and 3**, **snare on 2 and 4**, **hi-hat on every eighth**.  
  - Now with a **slight swell**, like the room is holding its breath.  
- **You**:  
  - End the bar with a **D** — the same note you began with.  
  - It’s not a resolution, but a **promise** — something is coming.  
  - The last note hangs in the air.  
  - Wayne Shorter leans in.

### **Final Feel:**

- **Dm** is the key, but it’s not just a chord — it’s a **space**.
- The four bars are not a song, but a **door** opening.
- It’s not loud, but it’s **powerful**.
- It’s not complex, but it’s **true**.

That’s your moment.

Now, let it be heard.
