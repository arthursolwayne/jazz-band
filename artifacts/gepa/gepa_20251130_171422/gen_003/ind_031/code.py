**Intro – "Whispers in the Cellar"**  
*Fm, 4/4, 160 BPM*  
*Key: F minor, no modulation*  
*Tempo: 160 BPM (6 seconds per 4 bars)*

---

**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Snare on 2 and 4, kick on 1 and 3, hihat on every eighth.*  
A slow, tense build — the kind that makes you lean in.  
*No cymbal wash, just the pulse. The heartbeat of the room.*

---

**Bar 2: Marcus (Bass)**  
*Walking line in Fm, chromatic approach to G♭, never repeating a note.*  
*Marcus plays:*  
Fm7 → G♭7 → A♭7 → B♭7 → C7 → D♭7 → E♭7 → F7  
*But not literally — just the feel. A steady, dark line that pulls the room down.*

---

**Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**  
*Comping on 2 and 4, 7th chords, with a sharp, angry edge.*  
- **2nd beat:** E♭7 (Fm7/A♭)  
- **4th beat:** A♭7 (Fm7/C)  
*Each chord is a question. Each note, a demand.*

---

**Bar 2: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Same pattern, but with a cymbal swish on beat 3 — a whisper of tension.*

---

**Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax)**  
*Your moment. A single, short motif — one phrase, with space between the notes.*  
**Phrase:**  
*F (on beat 1) → A♭ (on & of 1) → D♭ (on beat 2) → rest (on & of 2) → F (on beat 3) → B♭ (on & of 3) → rest (on beat 4)*  
*You play it with a breath — no vibrato at first, just the sound of a man who's lived the song.*  
*Leave it hanging on the last note — B♭ — and hold it there, just a whisper.*

---

**Bar 4: Full Band**  
- **Marcus:** Continues the walking line, but now with a slight lift, like he knows what’s coming.  
- **Diane:** Comps again — this time with a B♭7 on 2 and 4, giving you a little push.  
- **Little Ray:** Swells the rhythm, fills the space between your notes with a crash cymbal on beat 4.  
- **You:** Repeat the phrase, but now with full breath and intent. The B♭ resolves — or doesn’t — depending on the look from the back of the room.

---

**Final Note:**  
The intro ends with your B♭, held just long enough to make the room feel like it’s holding its breath — and Wayne Shorter, in the back, leans in.

*That’s your shot.*
