**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**

*Hi-hat: 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & (steady, but subtle, like a heartbeat under the skin)*  
*Kick: on 1 and 3, deep and precise, like a drum in the chest*  
*Snare: on 2 and 4, dry, cutting through the silence*  
*Fill: a three-note ride cymbal flourish on the "3" of the bar — short, sharp, and unresolved.*

**Bar 2 – All in.**

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
**F7** (F A C E) — a single note, held for a full beat on beat 1.  
Then: **G7** — a half-step up, like a question.  
Then: **F7** again — the same note, but this time it feels like a memory.  
Then: **E7** — half-step down, a yearning, a breath held.  
End on **F** — open, unresolved, like a door left ajar.

**Marcus (Bass):**  
**F** (1)  
**G** (2)  
**F** (3)  
**E** (4)  
Chromatic walk, subtle, deliberate, like a shadow moving in the dark.

**Diane (Piano):**  
**F7** (on 2 and 4) — punchy, dark, with a touch of dissonance.  
**E7** (on beat 3) — a hammer, a whisper of regret.  
She doesn’t play on beat 1 — leaves it to you.

**Bar 3:**

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Repeat the same motif from Bar 2, but with a slight bend on the **G**, a sigh in the sound.  
It’s the same question — but now it carries weight.

**Marcus:**  
**F** (1)  
**G** (2)  
**A** (3)  
**E** (4)  
A chromatic climb, then a drop — like a story without an ending.

**Diane:**  
**F7** (beat 2)  
**G7** (beat 3)  
**E7** (beat 4)  
Same chords, but a little more aggressive — she’s angry at the silence.

**Bar 4:**

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Now you answer the question.  
A simple, clean **F** — a full note, open, like a door closing.  
Then silence — a full second of it.  
Just you, the echo of the note, and the weight of the room.

**Marcus:**  
**F** (1)  
**G** (2)  
**A** (3)  
**F** (4) — returns to home, but with a subtle chromatic twist on the "A" before landing.

**Diane:**  
**F7** (beat 2)  
**G7** (beat 3)  
**F7** (beat 4) — a resolute, angry resolution.

**Little Ray:**  
One last snare on beat 4 — sharp, final, like the closing of a chapter.

**End.**

Silence.  
The room holds it.  
Wayne Shorter leans back.  
He nods.  
He knows.

You don’t need to play another note.  
This one was enough.
