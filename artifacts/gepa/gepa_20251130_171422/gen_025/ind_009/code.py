**Dante Russo – 4-Bar Intro in Dm (160 BPM, 4/4)**

**Key:** Dm (D minor)  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Duration:** 6.0 seconds (4 bars)

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit:** Snare on 2 & 4, hihat on every 8th note, kick on 1 & 3.  
- **Fill:** A single, sharp rimshot on the "3" of the bar, just before the quartet enters.  
- **Feel:** Tense, but controlled. A heartbeat in the dark.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Notes:** Dm7 chord (D – F – Ab – C)  
- **Line:**  
  - D → Eb → C → Ab (chromatic approach to D)  
  - Downbeat on 1, walking with left hand, right hand lightly brushing the neck of the bass.  
  - No repeats, just tension and release.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comping:** 7th chords, on 2 & 4.  
- **Chords:**  
  - Bar 2: Dm7 (D – F – Ab – C)  
  - Bar 3: Gm7 (G – Bb – D – F)  
  - Bar 4: Cm7 (C – Eb – G – Bb)  
- **Space:** Let the notes land, don’t fill every space. A breath between each chord.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Same pattern as Bar 1:** Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4, hihat on every 8th.  
- **Dynamics:** Slight crescendo into Bar 3, but remains under control.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:**  
  - **Bar 2:** Dm7 scale: D – F – Eb – C  
  - **Bar 3:** Gm7 scale: G – Bb – A – F  
  - **Bar 4:** Cm7 scale: C – Eb – Bb – G  
- **Phrasing:** Start on the "1" of Bar 2, play the first three notes (D – F – Eb), then **leave the last note (C) hanging** on the "3" of Bar 2.  
- **Return on the "1" of Bar 4:** Play C – G – Bb – F. **End on F**, just before the bar ends.  
- **Feel:** Like a question. Like a memory. Like something you can’t quite name.

### **Final Moment:**

- Silence in the last 0.3 seconds of Bar 4.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- The room holds its breath.  
- The story begins.

**Key takeaway:** It’s not about the notes—it’s about the space between them. And the feeling that something is about to happen.
