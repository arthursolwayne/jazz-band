### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick:** On beat 1 and 3 (snare on 2 and 4)  
**Hihat:** On every 8th note (open on 1, closed on 2, open on 3, closed on 4)  
**Fill:** At the end of the bar — a *brushed triplet* on the snare, starting on the “&” of 4, resolving on beat 1 of the next bar.  
**Dynamic:** Very soft (pp) — like the breath before a jump.

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
**Chord:** F7sus4 (F, Bb, C, D)  
**Voicing:** Open, left hand on F and C (root and 5th), right hand on Bb and D (9th and 11th, slightly detuned to add tension).  
**Rhythm:** Comp on beat 2 and 4.  
**Dynamic:** Begins soft (mp), crescendos on beat 4 to a sudden **forte** (f) on the final note (D).  
**Improvisation:** Adds a single chromatic passing tone on the “&” of 3 (G#) — a hint of something unresolved.

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
**Line:**  
- Beat 1: D2 (F minor 7th)  
- Beat 2: F2 (root)  
- Beat 3: G2 (b9, approached chromatically from G#)  
- Beat 4: C2 (5th of F7)  
**Dynamic:** Begins piano (p), swells slightly on beat 3, held at mf on beat 4.

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif (start on beat 1):**  
**Phrase:**  
- Beat 1: F (forte, full breath)  
- Beat 2: G# (soft, staccato, left hanging)  
- Beat 3: Rest  
- Beat 4: F (forte, but slightly behind the beat, like a whisper from the past)  
**Dynamic:** F on beat 1 (f), G# on beat 2 (pp), rest, F on beat 4 (mf, slightly behind).  
**Phrasing:** The first note is a full, bold statement. The second is a question. The rest is silence. The final note is a memory — incomplete, unresolved.

---

### **Final Effect:**  
- **Little Ray’s fill** at the end of bar 1 creates the first breath.  
- **Diane’s piano** sets the mood — dark, open, unresolved.  
- **Marcus’s bass** adds the foundation, emotional and rooted.  
- **Your saxophone** introduces the motif — haunting, incomplete, like a whisper from a dream you can’t remember.

**This is not a beginning. This is a question.**  
And the rest of the piece is the answer.
