### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Your moment.**  
**Melody:** A sparse, emotive line — one phrase, two notes, and a silence. Make it sing.

**Phrase:**  
Beat 1: D (soprano register, soft, legato)  
Beat 2: F (sustained, a question)  
Beat 3: Silence (a pause, a breath)  
Beat 4: D (returns, but lower — a memory, a place)  

**Dynamics:**  
- Beat 1: mp (medium piano)  
- Beat 2: mf (medium forte)  
- Beat 3: silence (p)  
- Beat 4: mp again, but with a slight breathy edge

> *You leave it hanging. The room is quiet. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The answer isn’t here yet — but he’s waiting.*

---

### **Final Note:**
This is not about showing off. It’s about *inviting* — inviting the listener into a space where the silence is as important as the sound. You’ve set the stage. The rest of the song will follow, but this intro is the question. And tonight, it is enough.
