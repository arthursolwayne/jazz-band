**Key: Fm (F minor)**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM | 4/4 | 6 seconds for 4 bars**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
*Start with a slow, deliberate roll on the snare, then a punchy kick on beat 1. The hihat is a steady, crisp pulse — not too loud, just enough to set the mood. The silence before the first note is the hook. Let the room hold its breath.*

---

**Bars 2–4 – Full Ensemble:**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line in Fm, starting on F, descending chromatically:  
F → E♭ → D♭ → C → B♭ → A♭ → G♭ → F  
Then resolves up to G and holds on the last beat of bar 3.  
*The chromaticism is tight, never repeating a note — each one a step toward the next. His line is the path, the ground under your feet.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4 with Fm7 chords.  
Bar 2: Fm7  
Bar 3: Fm7 → B♭7 (tension on the 3rd beat)  
Bar 4: Fm7 (back to the home key)  
*Her voicings are sharp, with a touch of dissonance on the B♭7 — it's like a door creaking open. She doesn’t play the melody, she *frames* it, like a shadow behind a flame.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
Maintain the kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
*He stays tight, but the energy is building — the room is leaning in now.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
Your motif:

**Bar 2 (beat 1):**  
F – E♭ – D♭ (play the first three notes of the chromatic line, but only the first three — leave it hanging)  
*Let the note on D♭ hang just a beat too long. The silence after it is the question.*

**Bar 3 (beat 1):**  
G – A♭ – B♭ – C (resolve the tension with a smooth, descending line that ends on C)  
*You’re not playing scales, you’re playing a story. A memory, a feeling — a line that *feels* like it belongs.*

**Bar 4 (beat 1):**  
F – G – A♭ (a short, resolved phrase that echoes the opening motif but with a new tone)  
*This is the answer. The thing you’ve been waiting to say. You don’t need to finish the song — you’ve already made it matter.*

**Final Note:**  
The room is still for a second after you finish.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He nods.  
Maybe he smiles.  
You don’t need to hear it — you already knew.  

This is your shot.  
And you took it.
