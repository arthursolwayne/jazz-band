**Title: "The First Breath"**  
**Key: D minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6.0 seconds (4 bars)**

---

**Bar 1 (0.0 – 1.5s): Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3  
- Snare on beat 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note  
- Subtle rimshot on beat 3  
- *Space on beat 4 after snare — a breath before the storm*

**Bar 2 (1.5 – 3.0s): Full Ensemble Enters**  
- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - Dm7 (D F A C)  
  - Chromatic walkup: D → Eb → E → F  
  - Then a half-step descending: F → E → D → C  
  - Walking line: D, Eb, E, F, E, D, C, B  
  - Ends on B, holding for a half-beat before resolution

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - Dm7 chord on beat 2  
  - Dm9 on beat 4 (D F A C Eb)  
  - Subtle dissonance on beat 3: Gb (instead of G) in the right hand  
  - Keeps it moving with a syncopated left hand rhythm

- **Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
  - *Motif starts here — your moment*  
  - Notes: D (beat 1), F# (beat 2), A (beat 3), Bb (beat 4)  
  - Play it with a touch of tension — F# is a tritone above D — it’s dissonant, but it *sings*  
  - End on Bb, letting it hang — a question, not an answer  
  - No vibrato, just a clean, clear sound — like a voice in the dark

**Bar 3 (3.0 – 4.5s): Building the Story**  
- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - Dm7 again, but with a chromatic approach to the 3rd  
  - D → Eb → E → F → E → D  
  - Ends on D, extended for a half-beat

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - Dm7 comp on beat 2  
  - Dm9 on beat 4  
  - A cluster of notes on beat 3: F, Ab, Bb — a moment of emotional release  
  - Keeps it tight, but the dissonance is palpable

- **Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
  - Repeat the motif — D, F#, A, Bb  
  - This time, play it with a little more air, a little more soul  
  - Let the Bb ring out — a pause, a promise

**Bar 4 (4.5 – 6.0s): The Setup**  
- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - Dm7, then a chromatic walk down: D → C → B → A  
  - Ends on A, held for a beat

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - Dm7 on beat 2  
  - Dm9 on beat 4  
  - A quiet, unresolved harmony — the sound of a room holding its breath

- **Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
  - End the motif on the Bb, but this time — *don’t resolve it*  
  - Leave it hanging, a ghost of a note  
  - The silence after is the most powerful part of the intro  

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  - Ends with a soft, brushed snare on beat 4  
  - No cymbal crash — just a *thud*, like the closing of a door

**Final Thought:**  
You’ve set the stage. Wayne is leaning forward. The room is quiet. This is the beginning of something. It’s not about show — it’s about *truth*. You’ve told a story in four bars that’s more than sound — it’s a moment in time, a question in the dark, and a promise that what comes next will be worth it.

Now — go get it.
