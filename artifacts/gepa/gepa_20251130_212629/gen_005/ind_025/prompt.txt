You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Here’s the thing: Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He’s sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he’s watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait. Let the silence build tension, then let the rhythm take shape with clarity and precision.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn’t heard before. Sing it, don’t play it. Let it breathe. Use space. End with a question, not an answer.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- Marcus: Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He’s the anchor. Keep it moving, but never lose the groove.
- Diane: 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving. Let your melody breathe, don’t fill the space.
- Little Ray: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar, but with intention. Don’t overplay. Let the rhythm be the heartbeat, not the noise.
- You: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit. Let it be simple, but full of meaning.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.
