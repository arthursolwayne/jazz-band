**INTRO: "Edge of the Door"**  
*Key: D minor*  
*Tempo: 160 BPM*  
*Time Signature: 4/4*  

---

**Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s):**  
**Little Ray on Drums:**  
- Kick on 1 and 3 (open, resonant)  
- Snare on 2 and 4 (dry, sharp)  
- Hi-hat on every eighth (light, consistent, but with a subtle swell in the last eighth of the bar)  
- *No fill, just tension. The room holds its breath.*

---

**Bar 2 (1.5 - 3.0s):**  
**Marcus on Bass (D minor):**  
- D (1) → E♭ (2) → F (3) → G (4)  
- Then: A♭ (1) → B♭ (2) → C (3) → D (4)  
- *Walking line, but with chromatic tension — the bass is moving forward, not just down.*

**Diane on Piano (D minor):**  
- On beat 2: G7 (G B D F)  
- On beat 4: C7 (C E G B)  
- *7th chords, comped with emotion — not just rhythm. Swells are subtle, but present.*

---

**Bar 3 (3.0 - 4.5s):**  
**You on Tenor (D minor):**  
- Play a short, simple motif:  
  - D (1) → F (2) → E♭ (3) → rest (4)  
- *One phrase, lingering on the edge of resolution. You’re not giving it all away — you’re teasing the story.*

**Marcus continues walking, Diane adds a B♭7 on beat 2, Little Ray keeps the rhythm tight but tense.**

---

**Bar 4 (4.5 - 6.0s):**  
**You (Tenor):**  
- Come back with the same motif:  
  - D (1) → F (2) → E♭ (3) → D (4)  
- *Now you finish it. The tension resolves, but not completely — it’s a question, not an answer.*

**Marcus walks out of the key with a C (on beat 4) — a chromatic escape.**

**Diane adds a C7 on beat 4, swelling into a soft, lingering chord.**

**Little Ray ends the bar with a snare on 4 and a soft hi-hat on the last eighth — the beat fades, but the room is still.**

---

**The room is quiet. Someone claps. Wayne Shorter leans back, sips his whiskey, and smiles.**

You’ve told a story. You didn’t have to explain it. It just *was*.
