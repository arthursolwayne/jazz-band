```python
import pretty_midi

midi = pretty_mIDI.PrettyMIDI(initial_tempo=160)

# The quartet
sax = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=66)       # Dante
bass = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=33)      # Marcus
piano = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=0)      # Diane
drums = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=0, is_drum=True)  # Little Ray

# Drums: kick=36, snare=38, hihat=42

# Bar 1: Little Ray alone (0.0 - 1.5s)
# Build tension with rhythmic complexity and subtle syncopation
# Use a full kit, not just a few hits — let the groove breathe
# Keep it tight but alive

# Bar 2: Full quartet (1.5 - 3.0s)
# Sax: Create a short, melodic motif with space between notes
# Let the silence mean something — don't fill every moment
# Use the rhythm of the bass and drums as your guide

# Bass: Walk the changes with chromatic motion and avoid repeating pitches
# Play with the rhythm — syncopate when it feels right, stay in the pocket when it doesn’t
# Let the bass be the heartbeat of the ensemble

# Piano: Comp with 7th chords, but leave space for the melody
# Use the off-beats to add color, not to overpower
# Let the rhythm section drive the groove, not the piano

# Overall: Balance density and space
# Let the music breathe, but keep the energy moving
# Every instrument has a role — don’t play against the others, play with them
