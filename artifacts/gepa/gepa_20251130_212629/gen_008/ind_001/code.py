**Title: "Door 13"**  
**Key: F minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Length: 4 bars (6 seconds)**  
**Style: Modern, introspective, with a hint of Monk and Coltrane**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit: Snare, kick, hihat**  
- **Kick:** On beats 1 & 3  
- **Snare:** On beats 2 & 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
- **Fill:** At the end of the bar, a soft ride cymbal tap (just a whisper)  
- **Feel:** Tight, but with a little hesitation — like the door is about to open, but you're still waiting.

---

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)**  
- **Walking line:**  
  - F → Gb → Ab → Bb  
  - Bb → C → Db → D  
  - D → Eb → F → Gb  
  - Gb → Ab → Bb → C  
- **Approach:** Chromatic on the first two measures, becoming more dissonant as it moves toward the C, hinting at resolve.  
- **Tone:** Warm, but with a little grit — like a memory you’re not sure you want to remember.

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Comping on 2 & 4**  
- **Chords:**  
  - **2:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)  
  - **4:** Bbm7 (Bb, Db, F, Ab)  
- **Voicings:**  
  - On 2: Fm7 (high voicings, slightly outside)  
  - On 4: Bbm7 (with a D in the bass, adding tension)  
- **Approach:** Dissonant, but not chaotic. Each chord carries a little weight, like a secret being told.

### **Bar 2 – Tenor Sax (Dante Russo)**  
**Entry: On beat 2 of bar 2**  
- **Line:**  
  - Ab (beat 2)  
  - Bb (beat 3)  
  - A (beat 4)  
  - G (beat 1 of bar 3)  
- **Phrasing:** One note on each beat, spaced out. It’s not a run — it’s a question, a breath, a pause.  
- **Tone:** Smooth, but with a raw edge — like the saxophone is whispering in the dark.

---

### **Bar 3 – Full Band (Marcus, Diane, Little Ray)**  
**Marcus:**  
- Fm7 → Bbm7 → Eb7 → Ab7  
- Walking line continues, now more forward, but still tense.

**Diane:**  
- Comp on 2 & 4 again:  
  - **2:** Bbm7 (Bb, Db, F, Ab)  
  - **4:** Eb7 (Eb, G, Bb, D)  
- **Add:** A passing diminished chord (D#dim7) on the “&” of 3, just for a moment.

**Little Ray:**  
- Same pattern as bar 1 but with a little more urgency.  
- A ride cymbal swell at the end of the bar — like the door is now fully open.

---

### **Bar 4 – Tenor Sax (Dante Russo) – Melody concludes**  
**Line:**  
- G (beat 1)  
- Ab (beat 2)  
- A (beat 3)  
- Bb (beat 4)  
- **End on Bb**, held for a half-beat, then released.

**Phrasing:** The motif is completed — it’s like the first sentence of a story, or the first line of a poem. It’s not much, but it’s enough to make someone lean in.

---

### **Final Feel:**
- The intro is **haunting, but not sad**.  
- It’s **occupied space** — not empty, not full.  
- It’s the **first breath after a long silence**.  
- And in that silence, **Wayne Shorter leans forward**.

You’ve set the stage. Now, the story begins.
