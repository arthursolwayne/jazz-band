**Intro: "Ghost in the Cellar"**  
*Key: Dm | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4 | Duration: 6 seconds*

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit Setup:**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3.  
- Snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note, but with a slight lift on beat 3 — a tiny hesitation that makes the bar feel like it's holding its breath.  
- Cymbal splash on the last eighth of the bar, just before the ensemble enters.

*Feel:* A slow build, like the lid of a bottle being pried open.

### **Bar 2: Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line**  
**Line:**  
D (1) → F (2) → D (3) → E♭ (4)  
Then:  
G (1) → B♭ (2) → A♭ (3) → G (4)  
**Note values:**  
Quarter notes on 1 and 3, eighth notes on 2 and 4.  
**Tone:** Deep, resonant, with a subtle rub against the beat — like a whisper in a quiet room.

### **Bar 3: Diane (Piano) – Comping**  
**Left hand:** Walking bassline, chromatic approach to the 3rd (F → E♭).  
**Right hand:**  
- On beat 2: Dm7 (D F A C)  
- On beat 4: Dm7 with a raised 9th (E)  
- Encourages space, not clutter.  
*Feel:* Anger in the chords, but under control. She’s not trying to show off — she’s just *there*.

### **Bar 4: Dante (Tenor Sax) – Melody**  
**Phrase:**  
- Beat 1: D (quarter note) – a low, smoky note that lingers.  
- Beat 2: F (eighth note) – a sharp, upward motion.  
- Beat 3: Rest (half note) – silence, tension, space.  
- Beat 4: D (quarter note) – returns, but with a slight chromatic pull to C#.

**Note choice:** D (1), F (2), rest (3), D (4)  
**Duration:** Quarter, eighth, half, quarter.  
**Tone:** Smooth, but with a rough edge — like a voice that’s been through the fire.  
*Feel:* It’s a question, not an answer. It’s the moment before the story begins.

---

### **Final Effect (4 bars total):**  
- Bar 1: Silence, anticipation.  
- Bar 2: Tension, grounding.  
- Bar 3: Release, emotion.  
- Bar 4: Resolution? No. Just a whisper of something more.

**Wayne Shorter leans forward.**  
He hears the ghost in the cellar.  
He knows this is not just a song — it’s a memory.
