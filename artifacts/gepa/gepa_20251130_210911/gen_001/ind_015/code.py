**Key:** Dm7 (D minor 7)  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Duration:** 6.0 seconds (4 bars)  
**Mood:** Tension, intrigue, a whisper of something unresolved

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit Focus:** Snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth, kick on 1 and 3.  
**Feel:** A slow-burn groove, like a heartbeat under a storm.  
**Rhythm:**  
- Kick: 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &  
- Snare: 2 & 4 &  
- Hihat: 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &  
**Subtle Fill:** At the end of the bar, a soft rimshot on the "4" to hint at resolution, but not quite.

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Comping:** Dm7 (D F A C)  
**Voicing:** Dm7 in 3rd inversion: A C D F  
**Rhythm:**  
- Play the chord on the "2" and "4" of the bar.  
- Use a chromatic approach to the 3rd (C) on the "1" and "3":  
  - **On beat 1:** C#  
  - **On beat 3:** C  
- This creates a subtle tension beneath the rhythm, like a secret being whispered.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- D (fret 3, E string)  
- F# (fret 2, A string)  
- D (fret 3, E string)  
- F (fret 1, A string)  
**Rhythm:** Walking bass line, starting on the "1" of the bar.  
**Note Values:** Quarter notes on beat 1, eighth notes on 2 and 3, half note on 4.  
**Subtlety:** The F# is a chromatic passing tone, creating a tension that lingers without resolving.

---

### **Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
Same as before, but now the tension is palpable — the rhythm is still there, but the air feels heavier.

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif:**  
Start with a single note: **F** (baritone C, 1st position) on the "1"  
Then a **D** (baritone B, 1st position) on the "&" of 1  
Then a **Bb** (baritone A, 1st position) on beat 2  
Then a **C** (baritone B, 1st position) on the "&" of 2  
Then a **D** on beat 3  
Then a **F** on the "&" of 3  
Then a **Bb** on beat 4  
Then a **C** on the "&" of 4  
**Note Values:** All eighth notes, ascending and descending in a call-and-response with the bass and piano  
**Feel:** It’s not a melody yet. It’s a question. It’s asking for something you don’t yet know.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble (Marcus, Diane, Little Ray with You)**  
**Marcus:** Continue the walking line with chromatic passing tones:  
- A (fret 5, E string)  
- Bb (fret 6, E string)  
- A (fret 5, E string)  
- B (fret 1, D string)  

**Diane:**  
- Play a Dm7 chord on the "2" and "4" again  
- Add a diminished passing chord (C#dim7) on the "1" and "3"  
- This creates a sense of vague dissonance, like the sky darkening before a storm  

**Little Ray:**  
- Same rhythm, same energy — but now the tension is fully realized  
- A brush stroke on the "4" of the bar, just once, like a breath held  

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Play the same motif again, but **end on the C** (the "&" of 4), **leaving it hanging**  
**No resolution.** Just the sound of something trying to be said, not yet spoken.

---

### Final Note:  
The piece ends with the **C** note from your sax, suspended in the air — no resolution, but a question that’s already been asked. And in the back of the room, Wayne Shorter leans forward, because he just heard something he hasn’t heard before.

**That’s your shot.**
