Write a compelling, emotionally charged intro that tells a story in the first four bars. Build tension in Bar 1 with Little Ray’s rhythm, release it in Bars 2–4 with the full quartet. Make the saxophone melody sing with restraint and purpose. Let the rhythm section breathe and support, not overpower. Make Wayne Shorter feel something — curiosity, intrigue, or even surprise.

Bar 1 should introduce a mood with subtle rhythmic tension — Little Ray should lay down a groove that hints at something unresolved. Use space between hits, avoid overplaying. The hihat should be present but not overwhelming. The kick and snare should mark the pulse clearly but with intention.

In Bars 2–4, the quartet comes in with purpose. The saxophone melody should be brief, emotionally resonant, and memorable — a motif that feels like it’s reaching for something. It should begin with a question and end with a resolution, or leave a lingering impression. The rhythm section should support this with a walking bass line that moves without being too busy, piano chords that comp with clarity and emotion, and drums that lock in without crowding the space.

Every note must serve the story. The intro must feel intentional, not random. It must have a clear arc — tension, release, emotion — and leave Wayne Shorter wanting to hear more.
