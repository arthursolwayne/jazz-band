**INTRO: "WHISKEY IN THE SHADOWS"**  
*Key: F Major | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4 | Duration: 6 seconds*

---

**BAR 1: DRUMS ONLY – LITTLE RAY**  
*Whispered energy, like a breath before the night.*

- **Kick**: On 1 and 3 (barely felt, soft, like a heartbeat).  
- **Snare**: On 2 and 4 (light, dry, like a sigh).  
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth note, but played with a soft, brushed sound, almost like a rustle in the dark.  
- **Fill**: No fill — just the rhythm. It's the setup. A question asked in the dark.  
- **Dynamics**: *pp* (very soft), like the moment before a story begins.

---

**BAR 2: ENTERING THE TELLING – YOU (TENOR SAX)**  
*Your motif begins — it’s simple, but it's searching. A question in a minor key, but the resolution is in F major.*

- **Melody (Tenor Sax):**  
  - **Beat 1**: F (F5) – a strong, open note.  
  - **Beat 2**: rest  
  - **Beat 3**: Ab (Ab5) – a half-step down, tension.  
  - **Beat 4**: rest  
- **Phrasing**: Let the rests speak. The note hangs, then falls away into silence.  
- **Dynamics**: *mf* (moderate), with a slight crescendo into the Ab on beat 3.

---

**BAR 3: DIANE (PIANO) AND MARCUS (BASS) JOIN**  
*The chords color the mood. Diane's voice is angry, but it's not noise — it's emotion. Marcus grounds it with walking line.*

- **Marcus (Bass)**:  
  - **Beat 1**: F2  
  - **Beat 2**: G2 (chromatic approach)  
  - **Beat 3**: F2  
  - **Beat 4**: C2 (resolve on the downbeat of the next bar)  
  - *Walking line: F – G – F – C* (MIDI 38 – 43)  

- **Diane (Piano)**:  
  - **Bar 3 Chord:** B7sus4 (B – F# – D – F)  
  - **Voicing:** Open, spread, with the root on the bottom and the 4 on top.  
  - **Comping**: plays the chord on beat 2 only, letting space breathe.  
  - *Dynamics:* *mf*, with a sharp, angular edge in the voicing — it’s the anger she carries.

---

**BAR 4: ALL TOGETHER – THE MOMENT OF SEARCH**  
*You return, finish the motif. Full ensemble, but it's not about volume — it's about clarity.*

- **Tenor Sax (You):**  
  - **Beat 1**: F (F5) – return to the opening note.  
  - **Beat 2**: rest  
  - **Beat 3**: Bb (Bb5) – a half-step up from Ab, resolving upward.  
  - **Beat 4**: rest  
  - *Phrasing:* Let it end with the rest. The story isn’t done — it’s just begun.

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - **Beat 1**: F2 (root of the key)  
  - **Beat 2**: G2 (chromatic)  
  - **Beat 3**: A2 (chromatic)  
  - **Beat 4**: F2 (resolve)  
  - *Walking line: F – G – A – F*

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - **Bar 4 Chord:** F7 (F – A – C – E)  
  - **Voicing:** Open, with a minor 9th (Ab) in the upper register, just hinting at tension.  
  - **Comping:** plays the chord on beat 4, a full, open voicing that colors the resolution.

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  - **Kick**: On 1 and 3 (slightly louder now, still not shouting)  
  - **Snare**: On 2 and 4 (more pronounced, but not heavy)  
  - **Hi-hat**: Still on every eighth, but with a bit more punch.  
  - *Dynamics:* *mp* (moderate), keeping the energy but not overpowering the melody.

**END OF INTRO**  
*Four bars. No scales. No fluff. A question, a tension, a resolution that feels like the beginning of a story.*

Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He’s heard it.  
It’s not perfect.  
But it’s *real*.
