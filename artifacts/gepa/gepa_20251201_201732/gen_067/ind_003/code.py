**Dante Russo – Intro in Dm (4 bars, 160 BPM)**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums) – The Breath Before the Storm**

- **Kick:** On 1 and 3 (tense, controlled)
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4 (dry, punchy)
- **Hi-Hat:** On every 8th (tight, but with a slight rub, like a whisper of urgency)
- **Space:** Leave the last 8th of the bar open, like a held breath before the fall.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass) – The Heartbeat of the Moment**

- **Roots and fifths with chromatic approaches**:  
  - D2 (root)  
  - F2 (fifth, with a half-step chromatic approach from E2)  
  - Cm7 (C2, E2, G2, Bb2) – resolve on the last note of the bar (Bb2)  
  - Line: D2 → E2 → F2 → G2 → A2 → G2 → F2 → Bb2  
  - *It’s not a line, it’s a feeling. A slow walk through memory.*

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano) – The Color of Anger and Longing**

- **Open voicings, different chord each bar, resolve on the last:**

  - **Dm9** – D, F, A, C, E  
    - Open voicing: D (left hand), A, C, E (right hand) – spaced out, wide, emotional  
  - **F7#9** – F, A, C, E♭, B♭, D♭  
    - Open voicing: F (left), B♭, D♭, E♭ (right) – a tense, unresolved color  
  - **Gm7b5** – G, B♭, D, F  
    - Open voicing: G (left), D, F, B♭ (right) – sorrow in the key  
  - **Resolve on Cmaj7** – C, E, G, B  
    - Open voicing: C (left), G, B, E (right) – soft, but full, like a memory coming back  
  - *Diane plays on 2 and 4 only, with space between. The chords "speak" — no busy comping, just emotion.*

### **Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax) – The Whisper That Carries Weight**

- **Motif:**
  - **Dm7** – D, F, A, C  
  - **Phrase:** D (long, legato) → F (slight bend, like a question) → A (sustained, like a memory) → C (half-step down to B, then resolve to D)  
  - *One short motif, not a run. It’s not about showing off. It’s about saying something that hasn’t been said before.*

- **Phrasing:**  
  - First note (D) is a long, clean tone.  
  - Second note (F) has a slight vibrato, like hesitation.  
  - Third note (A) is sustained, like a memory walking in.  
  - Last note (C) is a half-step down to B, then resolves back to D.  
  - *You leave it hanging like a question. Not an answer. Not a cry. Just a whisper that carries weight.*
