**Dante Russo – Intro in Dm (4 Bars, 160 BPM, 4/4)**  
*For Wayne Shorter, at The Cellar, 2am.*

---

**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Hi-hat on every eighth, snare on 2 and 4, kick on 1 and 3. A little too tight, but it makes the space feel like it’s closing in.*  
> `Kick on 1, snare on 2, kick on 3, snare on 4`  
> `Hi-hat: x x x x | x x x x`  
> *But add a ghost note on the "and" of 3 — subtle, but it gives it a little edge.*

---

**Bar 2: All in. Diane (Piano) comps with a Dm7 chord (D F A C), but with a flattened 9 (Eb) and a raised 11 (F#).**  
> `Dm7(#11): D F A C Eb F#`  
> *She hits the chord on beat 2, then plays a passing chord on beat 3: G7(#9) (G B D F# Ab) — a nod to Coltrane’s *Alabama*, but with a twist.*  
> *Her left hand walks a chromatic line: D C# B A — a little descent into the unknown.*

---

**Bar 2: Marcus (Bass) walks a chromatic line.**  
> `Dm7(#11) chord: D F A C Eb F#`  
> *Marcus plays the root on beat 1 (D), then chromatic line: D C# B A on beats 2-4. He hits the A on beat 4, then slides up to Bb on the & of 4 — a half-step resolution that feels like a question.*  
> *Line: D – C# – B – A – Bb (sliding up)*  
> *He doesn’t resolve — he teases.*

---

**Bar 2: You (Tenor Sax) — first note.**  
> *You start the motif on beat 2, with a Bb, then a D, then an E, then an F#. It’s a motive that’s not in the scale — it’s a tension that doesn’t want to resolve.*  
> *Phrase: Bb – D – E – F#*  
> *Long, legato, with a little rubato in the middle. It feels like a memory, like something you’ve heard before but can’t quite place.*

---

**Bar 3: Diane (Piano) continues with a Dm7(#11) comp on beat 2 again, but this time she adds a B7(#9) chord on beat 3.**  
> *B7(#9): B D# F# A C#*  
> *She plays it with a dissonant, wailing quality — like a cry in the dark. She’s not just supporting you — she’s pushing back.*

---

**Bar 3: Marcus continues with the chromatic line.**  
> *He plays the same line, but now he slides up from Bb to C on the & of 4 — a tiny resolution that feels like a breath after a long walk.*

---

**Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax) — continue the motif.**  
> *You repeat the same four notes, but this time you end on the F#, and hold it — a little longer, like you’re waiting for something to happen.*

---

**Bar 4: Diane (Piano) plays a diminished chord on beat 2 (D#dim7: D# F G Bb) and then a G7(#9) on beat 3 again.**  
> *She’s trying to push you toward something, but she’s not sure what it is.*

---

**Bar 4: Marcus walks a chromatic line again: Bb A G F — then slides up to G# on the & of 4 — another tease, another question.*

---

**Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) — finish the motif.**  
> *You play the final note, a high F#, and then a quarter note rest. The last note hangs in the air — silent, but full. It’s the end of the intro, but it feels like the beginning of a story.*

---

**Final Note (End of Bar 4):**  
> *Silence. The room holds. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The Cellar is quiet. You’ve set the tone. The journey has begun.*
