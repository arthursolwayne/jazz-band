**Key: Dm (D Minor)**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Length: 4 bars (6 seconds)**

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick** on 1 & 3  
**Snare** on 2 & 4  
**Hi-hat** on every eighth note  
**Fill**: A short, punchy ride cymbal on beat 3, just before the rest of the band enters.

This bar is tension. A heartbeat. The room holds its breath. Ray’s rhythm is clean, precise, and wide open — like the door to a room that’s been locked for years.

### **Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**

**Marcus (Bass)** – Walking line in Dm:  
- D2 (beat 1)  
- F2 (beat 2)  
- G2 (beat 3)  
- C2 (beat 4)  
*(Slight chromatic approach on beat 3: G2 → G#2)*

**Diane (Piano)** – Open voicings:  
- **Bar 2** – Dm7 (D F A C)  
- **Bar 3** – G7sus4 (G C D)  
- **Bar 4** – Cm7 (C Eb G Bb)  
She plays on 2 and 4, with a slight rub against the rhythm, like she’s pushing the beat forward slightly — it adds weight and urgency.

**You (Tenor Sax)** – Your motif:  
Starts on beat 1, plays a short, ascending phrase on the notes:  
- **D** (beat 1)  
- **F** (beat 2)  
- **G** (beat 3)  
- **D** (beat 4)  

But you **don’t play the D on beat 4**. You leave it hanging. Your reed vibrates, but you hold the note in your mouth — like a question, like a memory.

### **Bar 3 – Full Band**

**Marcus (Bass)** –  
- D2 (beat 1)  
- F2 (beat 2)  
- G2 (beat 3)  
- C2 (beat 4)  
*(Same line, but with a slightly more aggressive attack on beat 3, as if he’s pushing back against the tension.)*

**Diane (Piano)** – G7sus4  
- She plays a dissonant chord, a little too open, a little too slow — it feels like a door opening just enough to see what’s on the other side.

**You (Tenor Sax)** –  
You come back in on beat 3, repeating the phrase from Bar 2, but this time you **hold the D on beat 4**, and you **let it ring**, like you’re holding your breath after a long walk through the rain.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Band**

**Marcus (Bass)** –  
- D2 (beat 1)  
- F2 (beat 2)  
- G2 (beat 3)  
- C2 (beat 4)  
*(Now, he plays the C2 with extra weight, as if he’s finally stepping into the room.)*

**Diane (Piano)** – Cm7  
- She resolves the dissonance with a warm, rich chord that feels like a sigh — like the room finally exhaling after holding its breath.

**You (Tenor Sax)** –  
You don’t play a new phrase. You **end on the D** from your previous line. It’s the same note, but now it feels like **closure**. You’ve spoken your truth.

---

### **Final Note (You, Tenor Sax)**  
You let the note fade — not with a slide, not with a run, but with a quiet, **focused** release. It’s a note that lingers, not because it’s loud, but because it’s **true**.

Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
The room holds it.  
Something just changed.
