### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Rhythm:**  
- Kick on **1** and **3**  
- Snare on **2** and **4**  
- Hi-hat on **every eighth note** (open on **1**, closed on **2**, open on **3**, closed on **4**)  
- **Fill:** On the last eighth of bar 1 (beat 4, eighth note), a soft rimshot with a slight delay to create tension.  

**Feel:** A heartbeat, slow and deliberate. The room holds its breath.

### **Bars 2–4 – Full Ensemble**  
**Bass (Marcus):**  
- **Bar 2:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D) – root on beat 1, chromatic approach: E (beat 2), then F  
- **Bar 3:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab) – root on beat 1, chromatic approach: A (beat 2), then Bb  
- **Bar 4:** Fm7 again – root on beat 1, chromatic approach: E (beat 2), then F  
- Always walking, never repeating a note — a labyrinth of low-end movement.  

**Piano (Diane):**  
- **Bar 2:** Left hand: Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D) – comp on **2** and **4**, with a **Bb** in the left hand on beat 2, creating a dissonance  
- **Bar 3:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab) – same comp structure, but with an **Eb** in the left hand on beat 2  
- **Bar 4:** Fm7 again – left hand on **2** and **4**, with a **Db** on beat 2  
- Right hand: sparse, angular, playing **F, Ab, Bb, C**, but not in order, never resolving  
- **Ears are sharp, and anger is in every chord.**  

**Drums (Little Ray):**  
- **Bar 2:** Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hi-hat on every eighth  
- **Bar 3:** Same pattern, but with a **brush roll** on beat 4, building up to the release  
- **Bar 4:** Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hi-hat on every eighth, but with **cymbal swells** on beats 2 and 4  
- **The energy is building.**  

**Tenor Sax (You):**  
- **Bar 2:** Play a **short motif** – **F, Gb, Ab** – in **Fm**, but with a **blue note** flavor  
- **Bar 3:** Repeat the motif, but **shift it up a half-step** – **Gb, Ab, Bb**  
- **Bar 4:** Final bar – **F, Gb, Ab** again, but **end on a sustained Ab**  
- **No scale runs. Just a question. A memory. A challenge.**  
- Let it hang. Don’t resolve. The room is still waiting.

### **Final Moment:**

- The room is hushed. The tension is palpable.  
- Diane’s last chord lingers. Marcus holds the bass line. Ray’s cymbals fade.  
- You hold that **Ab** — a note that doesn’t belong, but feels like it should.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  

**It’s not over. But it’s enough.**
