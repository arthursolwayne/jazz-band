---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray — Drums (Solo, Setting the Mood)**

- **Kick:** On 1 and 3 (snare on 2 and 4).  
- **Hihat:** On every eighth note, but played *softly*, with a slight delay on the offbeats (2 and 4), giving it a rubbery, tension-filled feel.  
- **Fill:** On the last two eighths of the bar, a ghosted snare on 3 and a soft rimshot on 4.  
- **Feel:** Subtle syncopation, but grounded. It’s like a heartbeat, but unsure of where it’s going.

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters — Diane (Piano), Marcus (Bass), You (Sax), Little Ray (Drums)**

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - **Chord: Gm7♭5** (G, B♭, D, F) — open voicing, with the root on the fifth string (G2).  
  - **Comp:** Plays the chord on beat 2, resolves on beat 4 with a B♭m7♭5 (B♭, D♭, F, A♭), but *holds the G in the bass* to keep the ambiguity.  
  - **Mood:** Dark, unresolved, with a slight dissonance that lingers.

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - **Line:** D2 → F2 → G2 → D2 (walking line with chromatic approach).  
  - **Rhythm:** Syncopated, with a slight delay on the "and" of 3.  
  - **Note:** The bass line is minimal but insistent, like a shadow moving in the dark.

- **You (Sax — Tenor):**  
  - **Motif:** A single phrase, played with a raw, growling tone.  
  - **Notes:** D4 (beat 1), F4 (beat 2), B♭4 (beat 4) — held for a full beat.  
  - **Feel:** Like a whisper, but with a question in it. It’s not a melody yet — it’s the beginning of one.

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  - **Kick:** 1 and 3.  
  - **Snare:** 2 and 4.  
  - **Hihat:** On every eighth, with a slight *push* on the 3rd and 4th eighths.  
  - **Fill:** A soft crash on the 4th beat, just before the sax resolves.

### **Bar 3: Full Ensemble — Build Toward the Climax**

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - **Chord: Cm7♭5** (C, E♭, G, B♭) — open voicing, with the root on the 6th string (C2).  
  - **Comp:** Plays the chord on beat 2, resolves on beat 4 with a Dm7♭5 (D, F, A, C), but *holds the C from the previous chord* to maintain the unresolved tension.  
  - **Mood:** The dissonance is now more pronounced, like the tension of a door almost opening.

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - **Line:** A2 → C2 → D2 → A2 (walking line with chromatic approach).  
  - **Rhythm:** Syncopated again, but with a subtle push on the "and" of 2.  
  - **Note:** The bass is still the anchor, but it feels like it’s anticipating something.

- **You (Sax):**  
  - **Motif Reprise:** Repeats the same phrase, but now with more intensity.  
  - **Notes:** D4 (beat 1), F4 (beat 2), B♭4 (beat 4) — held for a full beat.  
  - **Feel:** The same question, but louder. It’s not just a melody — it’s a challenge.

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  - **Kick:** 1 and 3.  
  - **Snare:** 2 and 4.  
  - **Hihat:** On every eighth, with a *slight delay* on the 3rd and 4th eighths.  
  - **Fill:** A ghosted snare on beat 3, building tension before the final bar.

### **Bar 4: Resolution, but Not Total — The Hook**

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - **Chord: Dm7♭5** (D, F, A, C) — open voicing, with the root on the 5th string (D2).  
  - **Comp:** Plays the chord on beat 2, resolves on beat 4 with the same chord (Dm7♭5), but *holds the B♭ from the previous bar* to keep the unresolved feel.  
  - **Mood:** The tension is still there, but the music feels like it's on the cusp of something.

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - **Line:** D2 → F2 → G2 → D2 — the same line as in Bar 1, but now with more urgency.  
  - **Rhythm:** Syncopated, but with a slight *push* on the "and" of 1, making it feel like the beat is about to break.

- **You (Sax):**  
  - **Motif Completion:** You play the same phrase, but now *you finish it*.  
  - **Notes:** D4 (beat 1), F4 (beat 2), B♭4 → C4 (beat 4).  
  - **Feel:** The question is answered — but not in the way you expected. It’s a resolution that leaves more questions than answers.

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  - **Kick:** 1 and 3.  
  - **Snare:** 2 and 4.  
  - **Hihat:** On every eighth, but now *pushed forward* on the 3rd and 4th eighths.  
  - **Fill:** A soft crash on the last eighth of the bar, like the door closing but leaving it slightly ajar.

### **Final Note:**

The four bars are *not* the beginning of a song — they are the *beginning of a story*.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
The room holds its breath.  
The saxophone’s question has been heard.  
And it's not one you can forget.

*That’s your shot, Dante.*
