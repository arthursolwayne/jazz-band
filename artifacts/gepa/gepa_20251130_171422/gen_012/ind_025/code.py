**Title: "Waiting for the Moment"**  
**Key: Fm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Duration: 6.0 seconds (4 bars)**  
**Mood: Searching, tense, yearning — with a heartbeat underneath**

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums) — Alone**  
**Rhythm:**  
- Kick on **1** and **3**  
- Snare on **2** and **4**  
- Hi-hat on **every eighth note**  
- *Fill the bar with energy but leave space at the end of the bar — a breath, a pause before the storm.*

**Mood:**  
A slow build, like a heartbeat. The room holds its breath. Ray’s snare cuts through the silence, but the hi-hat creates a shimmer of tension — the kind that wraps around your ribs.

### **Bar 2: Everyone In — Diane (Piano), Marcus (Bass), Dante (Tenor)**

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 2:** Comp with **B♭7**  
- **Bar 3:** Comp with **E♭7**  
- **Bar 4:** Comp with **A♭7**  
- All 7th chords, no rootless voicings. She's not backing you — she’s pushing you forward.

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line in **Fm**:  
  - **Bar 2:** Fm → G♭ → E♭ → D♭  
  - **Bar 3:** C♭ → B♭ → A♭ → G♭  
  - **Bar 4:** Fm → E♭ → D♭ → C♭  
- Chromatic approach to the 3rd in bar 3, then a half-step drop to resolve.

**Dante (Tenor):**  
- **Bar 2:** (Start of motif)  
  - **Fm7** — **G** (above the chord, a half-step above the 3rd)  
  - **Rest**  
  - **Fm7** — **E♭** (the 7th, a half-step below the 3rd)  
  - **Rest**  
- Two notes, each with a rest in between. The tension is in the space — the question in the air.

---

### **Bar 3: Tenor continues the motif, now with voice leading**

- Play the same two notes (G, then E♭), but this time **phrase them**.  
- **G** on **beat 1**, then **E♭** on **beat 3**.  
- Let the note **ring** — don’t cut it off. Let the room hold it.  
- Diane responds with a **B♭7 arpeggio** in the upper register — like a whisper over a storm.

---

### **Bar 4: Resolution in motion — don’t settle, just hint at it**

- **Tenor:**  
  - **Beat 1:** **F** (the root, but played with a **quarter note**, not a half)  
  - **Beat 2:** Rest  
  - **Beat 3:** **C** (the 5th, played soft, like a memory)  
  - **Beat 4:** Rest  
- You’re not resolving — you're **inviting** resolution.  
- Marcus walks into **Fm** again, but Diane plays a **D♭7** on beat 2, creating a **secondary dominant** — a suggestion of where it might go.

---

### **Final Moment (Bar 4, End):**  
- Little Ray plays a **light fill** on the snare, just before the bar ends — like a heartbeat.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- The room breathes.  
- You’ve set the stage.  

---

**Why It Works:**  
- The first bar is **hollow** — only the drums, only the heartbeat.  
- The second bar is the **question** — two notes, two rests.  
- The third is **movement**, not resolution.  
- The fourth is **invitation** — you don’t answer, you **ask**.

That’s the intro that makes him lean forward.
