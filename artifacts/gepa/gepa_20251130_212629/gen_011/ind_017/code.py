**Key:** F minor  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM (4/4 time)  
**Duration:** 6 seconds (4 bars)  
**Mood:** Tense, intimate, searching — like the first breath before a storm.

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Fill:** Subtle ghost notes on the offbeats, a little rubato on the 3rd beat, like he’s holding back the opening of a door.

---

### **Bar 2: Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- **Beat 1:** Fm7 → Bb  
- **Beat 2:** Ab (chromatic approach to G)  
- **Beat 3:** G (suspended, unresolved)  
- **Beat 4:** F (back to the tonic, but with tension)  
**Feeling:** He’s the anchor, but he’s not sure where the ground is.

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**  
**Comp:**  
- **Beat 2:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)  
- **Beat 4:** Bm7b5 (B, D, F, A)  
**Left Hand:** Walking bass line, chromatic approach to the 3rd on beat 2  
**Right Hand:** Harmonic tension, dissonance that gives way just before the melody.

---

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (low, open, a question)  
- **Beat 2:** Ab (chromatic, like a whisper)  
- **Beat 3:** Rest  
- **Beat 4:** G (sustained, unfinished)  
**Feeling:** You start and then you leave it hanging. Not a run — just a story waiting to be told.

---

### **Bar 4: Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (root of the key)  
- **Beat 2:** Ab (chromatic approach to G)  
- **Beat 3:** G (suspended again)  
- **Beat 4:** F (back to the tonic, but with a hint of release)  

**Diane:**  
- **Beat 1:** Bm7b5 (B, D, F, A)  
- **Beat 4:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)  
**Feeling:** She’s pulling the chords back to where they started, but she’s not sure if that’s where they should end.

**Little Ray:**  
- Hi-hat continues, but now with a slight push on beat 3  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
**Feeling:** He’s pushing the tempo just a little — like he knows the story is about to unfold.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (low, same as before — a return, but not a repeat)  
- **Beat 2:** G (resolved, but with a twist)  
- **Beat 3:** Ab (chromatic, like a memory)  
- **Beat 4:** F (closed, but still open)  
**Feeling:** You finish the motif, but you leave the door ajar.

The room holds its breath. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The story is set.  
You don’t need to chase him — he’s already inside.

Now the real thing begins.
