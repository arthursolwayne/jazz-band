**Bar 1 (0:00–1:50): Little Ray on Drums**  
*Hi-hat on every eighth note, with a loose, breathing feel. Kick on beat 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. The rhythm is tight but not mechanical. The space between the beats is as important as the beats themselves. The crowd leans in. Wayne Shorter lifts his glass.*

**Bar 2 (1:50–3:40): Diane on Piano**  
*She plays a B7 chord on beat 2, a D7 on beat 4. No root, just the upper structure. The tension is high but not aggressive. She’s not playing for the room — she’s playing for the moment. The chords are sharp, like a blade held just above the skin.*

**Bar 3 (3:40–5:30): Marcus on Bass**  
*Walking line in F minor. Starts on Bb, moves chromatically down to Ab, then a half-step up to A. Each note is a question, and the answer is never what you expect. His fingers are fast but his mind is older than the building. He’s the keeper of the story.*

**Bar 4 (5:30–6:00): Dante on Tenor Sax**  
*You take the first breath — a single note, low in the register, a Bb. Then a half-step up to B, then a stumble back down to A. It’s not a melody yet, but it feels like the beginning of one. You hold the last note, A, just a little longer than the beat. Silence follows. The room holds its breath. Wayne Shorter smiles.*

This intro doesn’t scream. It whispers — and it leaves enough space for the next four bars to be whatever they need to be. You didn’t tell the story. You just opened the door.
