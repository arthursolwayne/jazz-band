---

**Bar 1 — Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3.  
- Snare on beat 2 and 4.  
- Hihat on every eighth note, but **lighter on the last two eighth notes of the bar**, creating a subtle release before the rest of the band enters.  
- A tiny cymbal swish on the "and" of 3.  
- **Feels like a heartbeat slowing down before the storm.**

---

**Bar 2 — Marcus (Bass):**  
- Starts with a **chromatic walk down from G to F**, resolving on F.  
- Then a **chromatic approach to Bb** (F to Gb to Ab to Bb), landing on Bb.  
- Ends the bar with a **rest** on beat 4.  
- **Rhythmic syncopation** on beats 2 and 3, avoiding straight walking line.  
- **Example (in F):**  
  - Beat 1: G  
  - Beat 2: Gb  
  - Beat 3: Ab  
  - Beat 4: rest

  - Beat 4: **Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)** — voiced as **D, F, Ab, Bb**.  
- **Space is key.** She plays only on 2 and 4, but with **unique voicings** and **left-hand movement** that hints at a walking line.  
- **Right hand:** A **half-step approach** from A to Bb, landing on Bb.  
- **Left hand:** Chromatic movement from C to D.

---

- Chromatic approach to **C**, starting from **Bb to B to C**.

**Bar 4 — You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:** F - Gb - A - Bb (half-step, whole-step, half-step)  
- **Rhythmic contour:**  
  - F on beat 1  
  - Gb on "and" of 1 (upbeat)  
  - A on beat 2  
  - Bb on "and" of 2  
- **Then it ends — just like that.**  
- No scale run, no filler.  
- **Leave it hanging.**  
- Let the silence speak.  
- Let the tension resolve without resolution.  
- Let the **memory walk through the door**.

**Final Moment:**  
- Silence for a split second after your last note.  
- Then Diane plays a **C7 chord**, Marcus walks into it, and Little Ray kicks in.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- You’re in.

**Key Takeaway:**  
This is not just an intro. It’s a **story in four bars** — a moment of tension, a question, a memory, and a breath before the storm.  
It’s **you**, and it’s **unrepeatable**.
