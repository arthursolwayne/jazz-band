**Intro – 4 Bars in Fm (F minor), 160 BPM, 4/4 Time**

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums) Only**  
*Soft, sparse, but present – like the first breath before a storm.*  
- **Kick:** On beat 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On beat 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note, light and precise  
- **Feel:** Subtle swing, with just a hint of tension

**Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line**  
Fm7 → G7♭9 → Am7 → B♭7♭5  
- Chromatic approach to G7: F♯ → G  
- Chromatic approach to Am: G♯ → A  
- Chromatic approach to B♭7: A♯ → B♭  
- Bass line:  
  `F – G♯ – A – B♭` (Fm7)  
  `G – F♯ – G – A` (G7♭9)  
  `A – B – C – D` (Am7)  
  `B♭ – A♯ – B♭ – C` (B♭7♭5)  
- No repeated notes, each step a question

**Diane (Piano) – Comping on 2 and 4 (7th chords, sparse but pointed)**  
- 2nd beat: Fm7 (F, A♭, C, E♭)  
- 4th beat: B♭7♭5 (B♭, D, F, A♭)  
- Play the chords with a slight dissonance, like a shadow passing over the room  
- No syncopation, just clean, angular chords

**Little Ray (Drums) – Full Kit, Pulse Like a Heartbeat**  
- Kick: 1 and 3  
- Snare: 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat: on every eighth  
- Feel: Slightly behind the beat, creating a subtle tension  
- Minor fill on beat 3: snare on 3, then a light cymbal on 4

**Dante (Tenor Sax) – Melody – The Question That Lingers**  
Starts on the & of 2, with a short motif that resolves on the 3rd beat, then leaves it hanging.

- **Bar 2:**  
  - **& of 2:** F (muted, breathy)  
  - **Beat 3:** A♭ (clean, clear)  
  - **Beat 4:** B♭ (hanging, unresolved)  

- **Bar 3:**  
  - No notes. Just a rest. A pause. A breath.  
  - The silence is deliberate, the space between the notes is the story.

- **Bar 4:**  
  - **Beat 1:** F (returning, but altered)  
  - **Beat 2:** A♭ (a step forward, but still not home)  
  - **Beat 3:** B♭ (yelling now, the question becomes a cry)  
  - **Beat 4:** A♭ (soft, unresolved, like a memory slipping away)

**End of Intro – 6 Seconds, One Question.**

It’s not a resolution. It’s a whisper in the dark. It’s the moment before the storm.  
And in the back of the room, Wayne Shorter leans forward.
