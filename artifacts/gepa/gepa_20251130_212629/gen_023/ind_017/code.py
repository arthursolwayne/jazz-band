**Title: "Edge of the Door"**  
**Key: Dm (D minor)**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1 – Drums (Little Ray)**  
**Rhythmic feel:** Tense, anticipatory.  
**Pattern (in 8ths):**  
`x . x x | x . x x | x . x x | x . x x`  
**But played with subtle syncopation and space:**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3 (slightly behind the beat to create tension)  
- Snare on beat 2 and 4, but with a slight delay on beat 4 (like a hesitation)  
- Hi-hat: on every 8th, but slightly off-center on the last two notes of the bar — as if holding back  
**Ending:** The final snare on beat 4 is a half-beat late, like the moment before something happens.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Quartet**  
**You (Tenor sax):**  
Motif:  
`Dm7 (D F Ab Bb) — Bb (from Dm scale) — Eb (chromatic up) — D (resolved, but leaning back)`  
**Phrasing:**  
- Start on the "and" of 1 (beat 1.5)  
- Play a short phrase: D (half note) – Bb (eighth) – Eb (quarter) – D (eighth)  
- End on the "and" of 4 (beat 4.5) — let it hang

**Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line in Dm:  
`D – C – Bb – A`  
Chromatic approach to the 3rd (C to Bb), then descending to A.  
After the D on beat 4, play a quick, chromatic slide down to G (but don’t resolve it yet)

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4:  
- Bar 2: Dm7 (D F Ab Bb) on beat 2  
- Bar 3: Dm7 on beat 4 (but with a Bb in the left hand, resolving the tension)  
- Right hand: a quick, dissonant run from Bb to C, then silence

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4, but with a slight delay on beat 4 again  
- Hi-hat on every 8th, but the last two notes are slightly behind, like a breath held

### **Bar 3 – Full Quartet**  
**You (Tenor sax):**  
Repeat the motif, but this time start on beat 1, and slightly change the ending — instead of ending on D, you end on C (the leading tone), leaving it open

**Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line:  
`G – F – Eb – D`  
A chromatic approach to the tonic, but not resolving yet.  
Play a half-step slide from G to F on beat 1, then resolve down to D on beat 4

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4 again:  
- Bar 3: Dm7 on beat 2  
- Bar 4: Dm7 on beat 4, but again with a Bb in the left hand  
- Right hand: a quick run from C to D, just before the end

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
Same pattern as Bar 2, but with even more tension on beat 4 — like the moment before a door opens

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Quartet**  
**You (Tenor sax):**  
Final phrase — take the motif and let it *resolve*, but not fully.  
Play:  
`D (half note) – Bb (eighth) – Eb (quarter) – D (eighth)`  
But end on the "and" of 4 again — just before the final beat

**Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line:  
`D – C – Bb – A`  
Same as Bar 2, but with a slight delay on the final A — like the last breath before silence

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on beat 4:  
- Dm7 chord, but with a Bb in the left hand  
- Right hand: a single C note, held to the end, like a question

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
Final beat:  
- Kick on 1  
- Snare on 2  
- Hi-hat on every 8th  
- End with silence on beat 4 — no snare, no kick, just the space

**Final Moment:**  
The room holds.  
You’ve set the stage.  
Wayne leans forward.  
Something is about to begin.
