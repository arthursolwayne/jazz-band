  "rationale": "The arrangement lacks jazz harmony with triads in the piano and bass instead of 7th chords. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat hitting only on the 'and' of 2 and 4 inconsistently. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or chromatic approach notes. There is no interplay between instruments as the trumpet is silent throughout and the piano plays block chords without comping. The overall feel is academic and lacks the swing and soul of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) minimum",
    "Add chromatic approach notes to saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in hihat pattern instead of straight quarters",
    "Use walking bass (roots, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) instead of just root notes",
    "Add ii-V-I progressions in bars 3-4 for authentic jazz harmony"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
