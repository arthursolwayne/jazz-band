**4-Bar Intro – Key of Dm | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3. Snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on every eighth.  
**But hold the kick on beat 3.** Let the snare fall on 2, but leave a slight gap on 3. The hihat continues, but *slight* rub on the 3rd eighth.  
It’s a tension, not a mistake. The silence between beats 2 and 3 is where the story begins.

---

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line, starting on Dm7.  
**D – F – Eb – C** (Dm7)  
Then:  
**Eb – F – G – A** (chromatic up to Bb)  
Wait on beat 4. Don’t resolve. That’s the question.

---

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
Comp with Dm7 on beat 2.  
**Left hand:** Dm7 (D F Ab C)  
**Right hand:**  
- Beat 2: F in the upper register  
- Beat 4: G in the upper register  
Leave space. Don’t fill the bar. Let the tension grow.

---

**Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Same pattern as before, but now with a *slap* on the snare on beat 4.  
The hihat is still there, but the slap creates a *bite* — like the first note of a scream.

---

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line again, but now with a **chromatic approach to D** on beat 1.  
**C# – D – F – Eb**  
That’s the first real step into the melody.

---

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
Dm7 again on beat 2.  
This time, she plays a **Dm7 arpeggio in the right hand** (D F Ab C), but with a **chromatic passing tone** on the third beat (Bb).  
Left hand: D in the bass.

---

**Bar 3 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3. Snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on every eighth.  
But this time, **the hihat is just slightly behind the beat** on the 2nd and 4th beats. It’s a subtle rub — like someone walking into a room that’s already full.

---

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
You start the motif on beat 1. It’s a **three-note phrase**, but it ends on a **rest** in the third eighth.  
**Notes:**  
- Beat 1: F (Dm7)  
- Beat 2: Bb (Dm7)  
- Beat 3: C (chromatic passing tone)  
- Beat 4: Rest.  

You leave it hanging. But then — just as the tension is about to break —  
**on the last eighth of the bar**, you play a **single note: D** — a clean, clear D, floating above the chaos.

You don’t resolve. You don’t explain.  
You just *ask*.

---

**Final Moment:**  
The room holds its breath.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He’s heard the question.  
Now he’s waiting for the answer.

---

**That’s the intro.**  
Now the song can begin — or maybe never will.  
But in those 6 seconds, you gave something real to the air.
