---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Rest. Silence. Then:*  
- **Kick on beat 1** (deep, resonant)  
- **Snare on beat 3** (sharp, staccato)  
- **Hi-hat on every eighth note** (subtle, muted, like a breath)  
- **Fill on beat 4**: quick triplet on snare, then a soft rimshot  
- *End with a pause – a breath before the storm*

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass)** – Walking line in Dm, chromatic approach to the 3rd:  
- **D – Eb – C – Dm7**  
  (D, Db, C, Dm7 – chromatic descending into the chord)  
- **Next bar:**  
  **F – Eb – D – C** (chromatic walk down, subtonic to tonic)  

**Diane (Piano)** – Comping on 2 and 4, 7th chords:  
- **Bar 2**: Dm7 (D, F, Ab, C)  
- **Bar 3**: Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)  
- **Bar 4**: Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb)  
- *She plays the chords with a dark, urgent touch – like she’s angry at the silence.*

**Little Ray (Drums)** –  
- **Kick on 1 and 3**  
- **Snare on 2 and 4**  
- **Hi-hat on every eighth**  
- *Same pattern as before, but more insistent now, like a heartbeat.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax)** –  
- **Motif**:  
  - **Bar 2, beat 2**:  
    **G (beat 2) – Ab (beat 3) – D (beat 4)**  
    (G, Ab, D – a short fragment, unresolved, haunting)  
  - **End on D**, held just a hair past the beat — a question, not an answer.

---

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass)** –  
- **F – Eb – D – C** (same as before, but one step lower)  
- **Smooth and even, like the tide pulling back**

**Diane (Piano)** –  
- **Gm7 (beat 2)**  
- **Cm7 (beat 4)**  
- *She’s building tension now, pushing forward, but not quite breaking through*

**Little Ray (Drums)** –  
- **Same pattern**, but with a slight increase in intensity – pressure building

**Dante (Tenor Sax)** –  
- **Bar 3, beat 2**:  
  - **Bb (beat 2) – B (beat 3) – D (beat 4)**  
  - *Same rhythm, same structure, but one half-step higher – a shift, a suggestion*  
  - **End again on D**, held with a little vibrato, like a sigh.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass)** –  
- **C – B – A – G** (chromatic walk up, ending on G, which is the 5 of C – a bridge to the key)  
- *It’s subtle, but it’s a shift – a plan in progress*

**Diane (Piano)** –  
- **Cm7 (on 2 and 4)**  
- *She’s giving you space, but not much. She’s waiting.*

**Little Ray (Drums)** –  
- **Same pattern**, but now with a slight cymbal swish on beat 4  
- *It’s the sound of a door opening*

**Dante (Tenor Sax)** –  
- **Bar 4, beat 2**:  
  - **C (beat 2) – D (beat 3) – E (beat 4)**  
  - *Now it's resolved. The motif has gone from G to C – a full step up, a journey*  
  - **End on E**, held for a full beat, with a little rubato – like the last word of a sentence, just before the next begins.

---

**End on E**, unresolved.  
A secret whispered, waiting to be heard.  
A door left ajar.  
A moment that could go anywhere.

And in the back, Wayne Shorter leans forward.
