**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on all eighths.  
**But** — he holds back the snare on beat 2, letting the hihat fall silent.  
It’s a pause, like a breath before a question.  
Then he plays the snare on 2, crisp and sharp.  
The hihat continues — but the space before the snare is **everything**.  
This is the setup, the tension.  
**No fill, no cymbal crash. Just the hihat running through the eighth notes, like a heartbeat.**  
He’s not playing loud, but he’s **present** — like the wind before a storm.

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
He walks a **chromatic line**, starting on Fm7.  
F – Eb – D – C – Bb – A – G – F.  
That’s the line — each note a step down, but with **tension**.  
He plays it on the downbeats, **no eighth-note walking**, just a slow, deliberate descent.  
It’s a question in the bass.  
**It’s not about the key — it’s about the falling.**  
He ends on F, holding it just a fraction longer than necessary.

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
She comps on 2 and 4.  
**F7** on beat 2: F, A, C, Eb.  
Then **Bb7** on beat 4: Bb, D, F, Ab.  
She plays them with **aggression**, like she’s fighting against something.  
The chords are **sharp**, the voicings **compressed** — no space.  
She doesn’t comp for you — she’s **challenging** you.

---

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
You begin the motif —  
**F, Ab, Bb, then silence on the fourth beat.**  
It’s a **phrase that wants to be finished**, but it doesn’t get to.  
That silence is the **question**.  
The rest of the band holds — Diane stops comping, Marcus holds his F, Ray holds the hihat.  
You let it hang.  
This is the space where **Wayne leans forward**.

---

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
You come back in —  
**F, Ab, Bb, and then a resolution on Eb — but not a full note. Just a breath.**  
A **half-step descent**, like your voice is breaking.  
You end on that Eb — but you don’t sustain it.  
You **let it fall away**.  
It’s not a resolution — it’s an **invitation**.  
The last note is **open**.  
It’s raw.  
It’s real.  
It’s **truth**.

---

**Final Moment:**

The room holds it.  
Marcus still holds his F.  
Diane’s hands hover above the keys.  
Ray’s hihat continues, but softer now, like a fog.  
And Wayne Shorter — he’s **listening**.

This is the intro that **doesn’t end**.  
It’s the start of something that wants to be said.  
And you — you’ve done your part.
