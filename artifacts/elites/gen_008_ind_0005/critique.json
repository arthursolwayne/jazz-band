  "rationale": "The arrangement uses basic triads in the piano and bass parts (C, D, G, Am, F) without 7th extensions or altered chords, resulting in a very simplistic harmonic vocabulary. The rhythm section has a basic backbeat pattern with some hihat syncopation but lacks the complexity of true Latin jazz. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop phrasing, chromaticism, or blues inflection. The trumpet is entirely silent, and there is minimal interplay between instruments. The overall feel is more like a music theory exercise than authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) for authentic jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes and blues inflections to the saxophone lines",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in the hihat pattern for a more authentic jazz feel",
    "Add walking bass lines with root-3rd-5th-7th motion instead of static triads",
    "Include call-and-response between the saxophone and trumpet for better interplay"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
