**Title: "The Door at 2:00"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Sparsely, with tension and restraint.*  
- Kick: On beat 1.  
- Snare: On beat 3.  
- Hi-hat: Quarter note on beat 2, eighth note on beat 4.  
- Cymbal swells on the offbeat of 3 and 4, like a gathering storm.

> *The room holds. The energy is there, but it’s waiting. A question in the dark.*

---

**Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters:**  
- Diane on piano: A single, unresolved chord — **Fmaj7** on beat 1, then **Bb7** on beat 2, creating tension.  
- Marcus on bass: A walking line in F: **F – A – Bb – C**  
- Little Ray: Light ride cymbal, steady but not pushing.  
- Dante (you) on tenor:  
  - **F – G – A – Bb**  
  - Play the first four notes of the motif:  
    > *F (quarter) – G (eighth) – A (eighth) – Bb (quarter)*  
    > *Let it hang at the Bb, not resolving. Whisper it into the room.*

> *This is the question. This is the moment that lingers.*

---

**Bar 3 – Full Ensemble:**  
- Diane: Now **Amaj7**, a pivot.  
- Marcus: **Bb – C – D – Eb**  
- Little Ray: Now with a subtle backbeat, pushing slightly.  
- Dante:  
  - Repeat the motif:  
    > *F (quarter) – G (eighth) – A (eighth) – Bb (quarter)*  
  - But this time, play the **Bb** a little longer, like it’s a memory trying to be remembered.

> *It's not just a melody — it's a feeling, a search.*

---

**Bar 4 – Resolution (but not full):**  
- Diane: **Fmaj7** again, but with a slight **C#** in the right hand — a hint of **F# diminished**.  
- Marcus: **Eb – F – G – A**  
- Little Ray: A soft roll on the snare, like a sigh.  
- Dante:  
  - Play the **F** again, but this time **hold it**, let it ring.  
  - No resolution, just the sound of something *almost* found.

> *The intro ends not with a statement, but with a question that lingers — just like the silence after the last note of a great saxophone solo.*

**End of Intro.**  
*The room is different now. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The story has begun.*
