  "rationale": "The arrangement lacks essential jazz elements. Piano and bass use basic triads (C-E-G, G-B-D) without 7th extensions, making the harmony sound like beginner music. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat hitting only two upbeats per bar, failing to establish a Latin jazz groove. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The trumpet is completely silent, and there's no interplay or call-and-response between instruments. The overall feel is stiff and academic, not swinging or jazz-like.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) minimum to add jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes to saxophone lines for bebop flavor and sophistication",
    "Introduce more upbeat syncopation in hihat pattern and add ghost notes on snare for authentic Latin jazz feel",
    "Use walking bass (roots, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) instead of just root notes for more engaging bass lines",
    "Add ii-V-I progressions in bars 3-4 for authentic jazz harmony and development"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
