Key: D minor

Time: 4/4  
Bars: 4  
Total duration: ~6 seconds  

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Kit: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth, but **light**, like a whisper under the floorboards.*

- **Kick:** 1, 3  
- **Snare:** 2, 4  
- **Hi-hat:** 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &  
- **Fill (optional, at end of bar):** A soft rimshot on 4, just to make the room hold its breath.

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
*Comping on 2 and 4, 7th chords, no clutter. Weighty, emotional. Let the chords speak.*

- **Beat 2:** Dm7 (D-F-A-C)  
- **Beat 4:** Gm7 (G-Bb-D-F)  
- **Voicings:** Lower register, close voicings, slightly dissonant (e.g., D-F-A-C becomes D-F-Bb-C on beat 2).  
- **Feel:** Like a sigh, like a memory, like something just walked in.

---

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
*Walking line, chromatic approach, never repeating a note. Momentum forward, not a pattern.*

- **Notes:**  
  - Beat 1: D  
  - &1: C  
  - Beat 2: Bb  
  - &2: B  
  - Beat 3: C  
  - &3: D  
  - Beat 4: E  
  - &4: F  
- **Arc:** Starts with D, circles around the C and Bb, builds up to F — like a question building.

---

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano)**  
*Same comping as before, but now the space is different. The room feels heavier.*

- **Beat 2:** Dm7 (again, but maybe with a Bb in the left hand for tension)  
- **Beat 4:** Gm7 (same, but with a slight delay on the F in the right hand)  
- **Left hand:** Slow, walking line in octaves, keeping the emotional weight.

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass)**  
*Continuation of the walking line, moving toward the resolution.*

- **Notes:**  
  - Beat 1: F  
  - &1: G  
  - Beat 2: A  
  - &2: Bb  
  - Beat 3: B  
  - &3: C  
  - Beat 4: D  
  - &4: E  
- *He’s not just walking — he’s telling a story.*

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
*Your moment. No scale runs. One short motif. Make it sing.*

- **Notes:**  
  - **Beat 1:** D (long, open, voice-like)  
  - **&1:** Rest (the room holds)  
  - **Beat 2:** F (short, staccato, like a question)  
  - **&2:** Rest (the breath before the answer)  
  - **Beat 3:** Bb (long, emotional, like the first memory)  
  - **&3:** Rest (again, the space)  
  - **Beat 4:** D (long, sustaining the note, letting it ring)  
- **Phrasing:** The first note (D) is a sigh, the second (F) is a question, the third (Bb) is a memory, and the last (D) is the beginning of a story.

### **Final Moment – Wayne Shorter**  
He leans forward. Not because it’s virtuosic, but because it’s human. It’s raw. It feels like the start of something he’s been waiting to hear — something that speaks to the soul, not the ego.

This is not just an intro. It’s a whisper in the dark. And the room, finally, is listening.
