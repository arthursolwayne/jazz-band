**Mood: Urgent, suspended, expectant**

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray – Drums (Solo)**
*(Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4, hihat on every eighth, but with subtle rubs and space. End with a question — not a resolution.)*

- **Kick**: D (1), F (3)  
- **Snare**: E (2), G (4)  
- **Hi-Hat**: E, F#, G, A, Bb, B, C, D (each eighth note, slightly behind the beat)  
- **Fill**: On beat 4, a triplet rub on the snare (not too loud, just a whisper of tension)  
- **End of bar**: Leave a small space — a breath before the storm.

### **Bar 2: Full Band Enters — You (Tenor Sax) Start the Melody**

**Tenor Sax (Dante):**  
Play a short, singing motif starting on the **& of 1**.

- **Motif**:  
  - **& of 1**: F (play it with a breathy, low tone)  
  - **1**: E (a slight drop, like a sigh)  
  - **& of 2**: D (hold it, let it hang)  
  - **2**: rest  
  - **& of 3**: C (a whisper, almost inaudible)  
  - **3**: Bb (a return, a question)  
  - **& of 4**: rest  
  - **4**: rest  

*Let the silence speak. The audience is hanging on the edge of something.*

- **& of 1**: F (same as the first note)

- **2**: rest  
- **& of 3**: C (same)

*This time, you come back, but you don’t resolve. You stop mid-sentence. The audience holds their breath. Wayne Shorter looks up.*

**Final Note**:  
You don’t need to play the resolution. The tension is the point. You’ve told a story in four bars — a question in a minor key, a storm on the edge of the door. It's not over. It's just beginning.

And now, the room is yours — the moment, the silence, the breath.
