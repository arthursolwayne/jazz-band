You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

**TIMING:** 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

**ARRANGEMENT:**
- **Bar 1:** Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait. The rhythm should feel taut and urgent, like it's holding back something powerful.
- **Bars 2–4:** Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn’t heard before. It should feel like a whisper that lingers, a phrase that wants to be remembered but isn’t finished yet.

**COMPOSITION RULES:**
- **Marcus (bass):** Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He’s the anchor. Let his line move in unexpected ways, keep it sharp, but don’t let it dominate.
- **Diane (piano):** 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving. Let the chords carry emotion, not just rhythm. They should feel like they’re pushing or pulling the melody.
- **Little Ray (drums):** Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar, but don’t overfill it. Let the rhythm build tension, not just noise.
- **You (sax):** This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that’s student shit. Let the phrase feel like it’s searching for something, not just showing off.

**ONE KEY. NO MODULATION. YOU'VE GOT 6 SECONDS.**

Make the intro feel urgent but poised, like it's on the edge of something. Let the drums build tension without being busy. Let the bass be precise and moving in unexpected ways. Let the piano comp with emotion, not just rhythm. Let the saxophone melody be simple but striking — something that lingers, that feels like a moment you can’t quite place.
