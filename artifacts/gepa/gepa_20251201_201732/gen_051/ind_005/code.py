**Kick:** 1, 3  
**Snare:** 2, 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note.

### **Bar 4 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick:** 1, 3  
**Snare:** 2, 4  
**Hi-hat:** Full, open on every eighth.

**Line:**  
- Bb2 (Fm 5th)  
- C2 (chromatic approach)  
- Bb2 (Fm 5th)  
- F2 (Fm root)  
**Rhythm:** Clean, on the beat, resolving on the downbeat.

---

### **Bar 4 – Diane (Piano):**  
**Chord:**  
- **Bar 4:** Fm7 (F, Ab, Bb, C) – open voicing, left hand: F on 1, Ab on 4.  
- **Comp:** Right hand: F, Ab, Bb, C – played on 1, +2, +3, 4.  
**Purpose:** Full resolution, but not complete — it’s a door, not a wall.

---

### **Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif (in Fm):**  
- **Phrase:** F – Ab – Bb – C  
- **Rhythm:**  
  - Bar 4:  
    - F on beat 1 (soft, breathy)  
    - Ab on “&” of 1 (a little behind, with a slight release)  
    - Bb on beat 2 (clean, full tone)  
    - C on “&” of 2 (a whisper, hanging in the air)  
**Purpose:** A short, lyrical phrase that begins the story. It’s not a solo — it’s a question. A breath. A statement that says, *I’m here. I’ve been waiting.*

---

**Ending the intro:**  
You hold that last note — C — just for a moment.  
Not too long, not too short.  
Just enough for Wayne to lean forward.  
Just enough for the room to hold its breath.  
Then, the next bar begins.

---

**Final Note:**  
This is not a statement. It’s a beginning.  
And in a room like The Cellar, sometimes a beginning is all you need.
