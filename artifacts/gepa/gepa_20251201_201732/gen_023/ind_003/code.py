**[INTRO – 4 BARS – D MAJOR – 160 BPM – 4/4 TIME]**

**BAR 1 – LITTLE RAY (DRUMS) ALONE**  
*Set the mood – the anticipation. The wait before the storm.*

- Kick: On 1 and 3 (D2)  
- Snare: On 2 and 4 (F#2)  
- Hi-Hat: On every 8th (D2)  
- Fills: A ghost note on the "and" of 3, a brush stroke on the "and" of 4.  
*The room is still, but the energy is rising.*

---

**BAR 2 – BASS + PIANO ENTER**  
*Marcus and Diane give the foundation, each with their own voice, but united in purpose.*

- **Marcus (Bass – D2-G2 range):**  
  - D2 (root of D)  
  - F#2 (chromatic approach to G)  
  - G2 (fifth of D)  
  - D2 (root, resolving)  
  *Walking line: D2 – F#2 – G2 – D2*  
  *A foundation that is both solid and soulful.*

- **Diane (Piano – Open voicings, bar 2):**  
  - F#m7 (F# – A – C# – E)  
  - Resolves to Dmaj7 (D – F# – A – C#) on the "and" of 4.  
  *A question in the key of D, answered with a chord that feels like the first light of day.*

---

**BAR 3 – YOU (TENOR SAX) ENTER – FIRST PART OF YOUR MOTIF**  
*You play the first phrase – not a run, not a scale, but a question. A cry. A whisper that knows it’s being heard.*

- **Tenor Sax (D):**  
  - **D (1st beat)** – a long, breathy note, with a slight upward bend  
  - **F# (and of 1)** – a ghost note, like the echo of a memory  
  - **E (2nd beat)** – a note that leans, like a question  
  - **D (and of 2)** – a return, but unresolved  
  *You leave it hanging. Let the silence speak.*

---

**BAR 4 – YOU (TENOR SAX) CONTINUE – SECOND PART OF YOUR MOTIF**  
*You pick it up again. This time, you don’t answer the question. You restate it, stronger, more certain. The rhythm pushes forward, the harmony carries the weight. Wayne leans in.*

- **Tenor Sax (D):**  
  - **F# (1st beat)** – a bold, inquisitive note  
  - **E (and of 1)** – the same ghost note, now with more presence  
  - **D (2nd beat)** – a strong return, a call  
  - **F# (and of 2)** – the echo again, but now it lingers  
  *You don’t resolve it this time. You let it live in the air.*

---

**FINAL MOMENT (END OF BAR 4):**  
The saxophone fades on the last note of F#, lingering in the room like a question that hasn’t been answered yet.  
The bass continues walking, the piano holds the Dmaj7, and Little Ray’s snare cuts through the silence with a final hit on beat 4.  
It’s not the end of the song. It’s the beginning of something.

**Wayne Shorter looks up.**  
He nods.  
He’s listening.
