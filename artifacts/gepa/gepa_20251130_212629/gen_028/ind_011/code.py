### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Time: 0.00 – 1.50s**  
**Pattern:**  
- Kick on beat 1 (strong, slightly behind the beat).  
- Snare on beat 3 (light, with a slight drag on the downbeat).  
- Hi-hat on every eighth, but with subtle dynamic variation:  
  - Eighth 1: soft  
  - Eighth 2: medium  
  - Eighth 3: soft  
  - Eighth 4: loud  
  - Repeat, with a slight shift in the third hi-hat of the second half to be **1/16th late**.  
- Cymbal roll at the end of the bar, just before the bass enters — **very quiet**, like a breath.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Time: 1.50 – 3.00s**  
**Line:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (open string) – **soft, with a slight delay**  
- **Beat 2:** G♭ (chromatic approach) – **pulled in slightly**  
- **Beat 3:** A (walking line) – **staccato, punchy**  
- **Beat 4:** B♭ (resolution) – **sustained, a little louder than surrounding notes**  
- **Subtle rhythmic shift:** The third beat is played **a 16th note early**, creating a small rub against the snare.

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Time: 1.50 – 3.00s**  
**Comping:**  
- **Beat 2:** F7 (F A C E) – **voiced with left hand, medium dynamics**  
- **Beat 4:** F7 again, but with a **left-hand F in the bass, right hand A E**, **played slightly ahead of the beat**  
- **Subtle metric modulation:** The first chord on beat 2 is played **with a 1/8th rest before the chord**, creating a slight hesitation.

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Time: 3.00 – 4.50s**  
**Motif:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (open, breathy, slightly behind the beat) – **soft, like a whisper**  
- **Beat 2:** G (up a whole step) – **sudden, with a little vibrato**  
- **Beat 3:** A (chromatic again, but **just a half-step below the expected note**) – **swallowed**  
- **Beat 4:** B♭ (resolution) – **held for a full beat**, **but played with a slight grace note before it**, **ending on a rest**  
- **No scale run, no resolution. Just a question left hanging.**

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble (Marcus, Diane, Little Ray)**  
**Time: 4.50 – 6.00s**  
**Build:**  
- **Marcus:**  
  - **Beat 1:** F (sustained, with a slight rub on the downbeat)  
  - **Beat 2:** G (chromatic again, but with a slight **1/16th delay**)  
- **Diane:**  
  - **Beat 2:** F7 again, but this time, **right hand plays B♭ and E**, **with a very soft A in the left hand beneath**  
  - **Beat 4:** F7 again, but the **left hand plays A**, **soft, like a memory**  
- **Little Ray:**  
  - **Beat 1:** Kick on 1, with a **snare on 3**  
  - **Hi-hats:** All eighth notes, but with a **brief 1/16th rest on the third eighth**  
- **You (Tenor):**  
  - **Rest throughout the bar**, **but with a breathy, almost inaudible hum on the last eighth**  
  - **The last note is left unplayed. Just silence.**  
  - **It’s not a resolution. It’s a question.**

---

### **Final Moment (End of Bar 4):**  
- The room is quiet.  
- The last note is in the air.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- The door is open.  
- The song hasn’t started yet.  
- But it’s already happening.

**That’s your intro, Dante.**  
**You don’t play the sound. You play the space.**  
**And that’s what he’s here for.**
