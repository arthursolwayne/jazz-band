**"Whisper in the Cellar" — Intro (4 bars in D major)**

**TEMPO:** 160 BPM  
**TIME SIGNATURE:** 4/4  
**KEY:** D Major  
**DURATION:** 6 seconds  
**MOOD:** Haunting, unresolved, like a memory you never quite remember.

### **BAR 1 (0.0 - 1.5s): Little Ray on Drums**

**Kit:**
- Kick on beat 1
- Snare on beat 3
- Hi-hat on every eighth note
- Fill on beat 2 (light brush on snare, no cymbal)

**Feel:** A slow build, almost like a heartbeat. The silence between hits is as important as the hits themselves. The energy is quiet but urgent. Ray’s playing like he’s waiting to be heard, but he’s not sure what to say.

### **BAR 2 (1.5 - 3.0s): Enter Diane on Piano**

**Chords:**
- **Measure 2, beat 1:** C7 (D major scale, but with a borrowed chord)
- **Measure 2, beat 2:** G7 (chromatic approach to A)
- **Measure 2, beat 3:** Bm7 (subdominant color, unresolved)
- **Measure 2, beat 4:** F#7 (chromatic movement up from Bm7 — leading to a mysterious place)

**Comping:** Diane plays on beats 2 and 4. Each chord is a question. The voicings are open, with space between the notes. She’s not playing for the room — she’s playing for the moment.

### **BAR 3 (3.0 - 4.5s): Marcus on Bass Enters**

**Line:**
- **Beat 1:** D (root)
- **Beat 2:** F# (chromatic approach to G)
- **Beat 3:** A (third of D)
- **Beat 4:** C (chromatic approach to B)

**Feel:** Marcus is the anchor, but he’s not playing the expected bass line. He’s walking a chromatic line, not just up and down the scale. His line is tight, strange, and full of tension. He’s not stating the key — he’s questioning it.

### **BAR 4 (4.5 - 6.0s): Dante on Tenor Sax — The Melody**

**Motif:**
- **Beat 1:** D (soprano register, soft and breathy)
- **Beat 2:** F# (chromatic up)
- **Beat 3:** A (third of D)
- **Beat 4:** C (chromatic down, unresolved)

**Phrasing:** You play the motif with a whisper — one note per beat. It's simple, but it's not "D major." It’s D, but with a strange color. You leave it hanging on the last note — the C — like a question. No run, no flourish. Just a memory you can't place.

**Space:** After the last note, you hold the breath for a half-second. No one plays. The room holds it. Wayne Shorter leans forward.

**END OF INTRO.**  
The silence is louder than the music.  
The question is more powerful than the answer.  
And you’ve just written a new page in the book of jazz.
