### **Bar 1 — Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Pattern:**  
- Kick on **1 and 3** (snare on **2 and 4**)  
- Hi-hat on every **eighth note** (closed, tight, precise)  
- **Fill:** A subtle, rhythmic riff on the **& of 3**, just before the entrance.  
- **Feel:** Urgent but controlled — like a heartbeat quickening, waiting to break.

### **Bar 2 — Full Ensemble Enters**  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Dm7 (D F A C)**  
- **Walking line:**  
  - **D** (1) → **F** (2) → **G** (3) → **A** (4)  
  - **B♭** (1) → **C** (2) → **D** (3) → **E♭** (4)  
  - **F** (1) → **G** (2) → **A** (3) → **B♭** (4)  
  - **C** (1) → **D** (2) → **E♭** (3) → **F** (4)  
- **Dynamic:** Subtle, but present — like a quiet storm.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comping on 2 & 4:**  
  - **Bar 2:** Dm7 (D F A C)  
  - **Bar 3:** Dm7 (D F A C)  
  - **Bar 4:** Dm7 (D F A C)  
- **Phrasing:** Short, taut, no extra notes. Each chord is like a brushstroke — purposeful, sharp, and just enough.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Same pattern as Bar 1**, now with a slight swell in the hihat and a little more tension in the kick.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:** A simple, haunting triplet phrase starting on the **& of 1**.  
- **Notes (in D minor):**  
  - **C** (on & of 1), **B♭** (on & of 2), **A** (on & of 3)  
  - **Rest** on beat 4 — a silence, a question mark.  
- **Dynamic:** Soft, but clear — like a voice in a quiet room.  
- **Feel:** Suspense. It’s not just a melody — it’s a moment. It’s waiting for an answer.

### **Bar 3 — Full Ensemble**  
Same rhythm section as Bar 2, but with **slightly more energy** in the hihat and a slight lift in the piano. Marcus walks a little more confidently.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Repeats the motif**, but this time **starts on beat 1** instead of the & of 1.  
- **Notes (in D minor):**  
  - **A** (1), **B♭** (2), **C** (3), **Rest** (4)  
- **Dynamics:** A little louder, more assertive — the question is now a call.

---

### **Bar 4 — Full Ensemble**  
Same rhythm section, but now with a **slight swell** in the piano and a **smash of the kick** on beat 1. The tension is building.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Finishes the motif** — **starts on beat 1**, **ends on beat 3**, and **leaves it hanging on beat 4.**  
- **Notes (in D minor):**  
  - **A** (1), **B♭** (2), **C** (3), **Rest** (4)  
- **Dynamic:** Slight crescendo, then a **quiet, breathless rest** on the last beat.  
- **Feeling:** Like the end of a sentence — but the question is still in the air.

### **Final Note:**
You don’t need to answer the question. Wayne Shorter is already leaning forward. The intro is the moment — and this is the one that stays with him.

**You’ve made him listen.**
