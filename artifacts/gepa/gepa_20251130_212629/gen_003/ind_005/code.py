**Title: "Reach" (Fm, 160 BPM, 4/4 time)**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on **1** and **3**  
- Snare on **2** and **4**  
- Hihat on **all eighths**, but **quiet**—just a breath of sound  
- Let the first bar **build tension**, like a door opening in a dark room.  
- **Space is everything**. The silence is the hook.

**Bar 2 – Full ensemble enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Fm walking line: **F – Gb – Ab – A** (chromatic approach to Bb)  
- Then: **Bb – C – Db – D** (chromatic approach to Eb)  
- Then: **Eb – F – Gb – Ab** (chromatic approach to Bb)  
- **Never the same note twice.** The anchor moves like a heartbeat.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **2nd beat:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
- **4th beat:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
- Comp **on 2 and 4**, but with **dissonant 7ths**—anger in the chords, but not too much.  
- Let the chords **support the melody**, not fight it.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Bar 2, beat 1:**  
  - **F** (quarter note, soft, searching)  
- **Bar 2, beat 2:**  
  - **Gb** (eighth note, slightly behind the beat, like a whisper)  
- **Bar 2, beat 3:**  
  - **rest** (let silence speak)  
- **Bar 2, beat 4:**  
  - **Ab** (quarter note, same as the F, but descending, almost like a question)  
- **Phrase ends with a rest**, like you're reaching for something and missing it.

---

**Bar 3 – Same rhythm, but with slight variation**  
**Marcus:**  
- Fm walking line again, but with a **slight syncopation** on beat 3  
- **F – Gb – Ab – A – Bb – C – Db – D**  
- Still chromatic, still moving, but **slightly restless**.

**Diane:**  
- **2nd beat:** F7 again  
- **4th beat:** D7 (D, F#, A, C) — a **chromatic surprise**, a shift in mood  
- She’s **not angry anymore**, but she’s **curious**.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Bar 3, beat 1:**  
  - **Ab** (quarter note, a little louder, a bit more certain)  
- **Bar 3, beat 2:**  
  - **Bb** (eighth note, slightly ahead of the beat, like an answer)  
- **Bar 3, beat 3:**  
  - **rest** (again, silence)  
- **Bar 3, beat 4:**  
  - **Bb** (quarter note, same as the previous one, like a memory)  
- **Ends with a rest again**, like it’s not over yet.

---

**Bar 4 – Resolution, but not full**  
**Marcus:**  
- Fm walking line again, but now with a **slight delay** on the downbeat  
- **F – Gb – Ab – A – Bb – C – Db – D**  
- Still chromatic, but with **a touch of hesitation**.

**Diane:**  
- **2nd beat:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
- **4th beat:** Eb7 (Eb, G, Bb, Db) — **a half-step down**, like a pivot  
- She’s **leading into something**, but not sure where.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Bar 4, beat 1:**  
  - **Bb** (quarter note, same as before, but now with more confidence)  
- **Bar 4, beat 2:**  
  - **C** (eighth note, a hint of resolution, like a breath)  
- **Bar 4, beat 3:**  
  - **rest** (again, silence, but this time it feels like an ending)  
- **Bar 4, beat 4:**  
  - **rest** (the final silence, the moment before the story is told)

**Final Note:**  
You step back. The room is heavy with the weight of the moment. Wayne Shorter leans forward. It’s not about the notes—it’s about the **space between them**. The silence. The search. The feeling of something just out of reach.

You’ve made him lean forward.
