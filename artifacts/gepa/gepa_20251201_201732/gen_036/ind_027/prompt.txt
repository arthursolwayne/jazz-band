You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

**TIMING**: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

**ARRANGEMENT**:
- **Bar 1**: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait. Build tension with clarity and momentum.
- **Bars 2-4**: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before — something that lingers, something that breathes, something that feels like it's been waiting to be played.

**COMPOSITION RULES**:
- **Marcus (bass)**: Walking line (D2-G2, MIDI 38-43), roots and fifths with chromatic approaches, not scales. He's the anchor. Let his line be steady, but with subtle tension.
- **Diane (piano)**: Open voicings, different chord each bar, resolve on the last. Comp on 2 and 4. Let her chords speak with emotion — they should feel like they're reacting to the mood, not just supporting it.
- **Little Ray (drums)**: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar with energy and clarity. Don’t be afraid to be precise, but never boring.
- **You (tenor sax)**: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit. Let your phrase have space, let it breathe, let it speak in a way that feels honest and new.

**One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.**

**Your goal**: Craft a moment that feels like it was always meant to be heard — a melody that grabs the ear, lingers in the mind, and leaves room for something more. Make it personal, make it real, and make it worth listening to again.
