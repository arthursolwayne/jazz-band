**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Kick on **1** (full, low tone)  
- Snare on **2**  
- Hihat on **& of 1**, **& of 2**, **& of 3**, **& of 4**  
- Fill: **On beat 3**, a quick *rimshot* and a *brush roll* that fades into silence  
- **Rest:** 2nd half of bar is empty — just the hihat’s *click click click* on the off-beats, like a heartbeat

**Bar 2: Marcus (Bass)**  
- Starts on **beat 2** with a **chromatic line**:  
  **F** → **F#** → **G** → **Ab** (played in eighth notes)  
- Then walks up: **Bb** → **B** → **C** → **Db** (quarter notes)  
- Ends on **C** (beat 4), open and unresolved

**Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**  
- Compares on **2 and 4** with **F7** chords:  
  - **2:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb) — but with a **b9** (Ab) in there, giving it a tense, modern feel  
  - **4:** F7 again, but with a **#11** (B)  
- Left hand: **Walking bass line** that mirrors Marcus but with a slight delay — like a shadow

**Bar 2: You (Tenor Sax)**  
- Silence.  
- Wait.  
- Let it breathe.  
- The last note of Marcus is **C**, and you hold it.  
- You do **nothing**.  
- Just a **rest** on beat 4, but not empty — it’s like the room is holding its breath.

---

**Bar 3: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Kick on **1** again, but this time with more urgency  
- Snare on **2**  
- Hihat on every eighth, but now with a **reverse fill** on beat 3:  
  - Snare roll descending from **3** to **1** (like a falling wind)  
- Ends with a **cymbal crash** on beat 4 — but held open, not struck

**Bar 3: Marcus (Bass)**  
- Chromatic again, but this time **descending**:  
  **C** → **B** → **Bb** → **A**  
- Ends on **A**, a half-step lower than the F7 chord — it's a question

**Bar 3: Diane (Piano)**  
- Compares on **2 and 4** again  
- **2:** F7 with **b13** (Db)  
- **4:** F7 with **b9** (Ab)  
- Left hand: Slides down with Marcus — a **moving, chromatic line** that echoes the tension

**Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax)**  
- Your **motif** starts now.  
- You play a **three-note phrase** on the **& of 1, 2, and & of 3**:  
  - **F** (half note, open, breathy)  
  - **Ab** (quarter note, sharp, like a question)  
  - **Bb** (eight note, held just a beat too long)  
- Then you **rest** on **beat 4** — the last note is **Bb**, but it’s **not resolved**  
- You don’t play the next note.  
- You **pose the question**.

**Bar 4: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Kick on **1**  
- Snare on **2**  
- Hihat on every eighth  
- **Fill on beat 3**: A **brush roll** in the high toms, like a whisper  
- Ends on a **closed hi-hat** on **beat 4**, but only half-pressed — it’s waiting

**Bar 4: Marcus (Bass)**  
- Chromatic line again, but now **upward**:  
  **A** → **Bb** → **B** → **C**  
- Ends on **C**, but played **half a beat late** — like it’s catching up

**Bar 4: Diane (Piano)**  
- **2 and 4**:  
  - **2:** F7 with **#11** (B)  
  - **4:** F7 with **13** (A)  
- Left hand: Mirrors Marcus, but **slightly ahead** — like she's leading the way

**Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax)**  
- You **answer** the question with **three more notes**, but now you’re **singing**  
- **C** (half note, open, like a sigh)  
- **Bb** (quarter note, like a memory)  
- **F** (eighth note, held just a beat too long)  
- Then you **rest**, but not empty — your breath is still in the air, and the room is waiting

---

**Ending:**  
- The final note is **F**, on the **& of 4**, and you **don’t resolve it**  
- You **leave it hanging** — like a story that’s just beginning  
- Wayne leans forward.

**That’s the intro.**  
It’s not a statement. It’s a **question in a key** — and it’s one you’ve never heard before.
