### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Set the mood. A slow build, with tension in the silence before the storm.*

- **Kick:** On 1 and 3 (open, dry, with subtle snap)  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4 (slap, just enough to make the room breathe)  
- **Hi-hat:** On every 8th note (closed, tight, with a slight decay)  
- **Fill:** On the “& of 4” — a quick ride cymbal roll, building to a pause before the band enters.

> *The room is quiet. The bulb flickers. The saxophone is still. Little Ray’s heartbeat.*

### **Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**  
*Dante takes the melody — a phrase that lingers, like a question in the dark.*

**Tenor Sax (Dante):**  
- **D4 (1)** – held for half a beat  
- **F4 (2)** – held for half a beat  
- **G4 (3)** – short, staccato  
- **Rest (4)** – silence, but not empty

> *A question is asked, not answered. The air holds.*

**Piano (Diane):**  
- **Chord on beat 2:** Bb7 (D–F–Ab–Bb), open voicing, highest note on top  
- **Chord on beat 4:** Cm7 (C–Eb–G–Bb), with a diminished note (B) in the left hand  
- *She plays it angry, but with clarity. A half-suggestion of a resolution, but not quite.*

**Bass (Marcus):**  
- **Roots and fifths:** D (1), A (2), F (3), C (4)  
- **Chromatic approach on beat 2:** Eb (chromatic lead into F)  
- *He’s the anchor, but he leans into the tension.*

**Drums (Little Ray):**  
- **Kick:** 1, 3  
- **Snare:** 2, 4  
- **Hi-hat:** every 8th (closed, but with a soft decay)  
- *He keeps the energy, but doesn’t push yet.*

### **Bar 3 – Dante’s Motif (cont.)**  
*The saxophone returns — with a twist. A rest between the phrases, like a breath, but sharp.*

**Tenor Sax (Dante):**  
- **Rest (1)** – silence, but with intent  
- **Bb4 (2)** – short, clipped  
- **C4 (3)** – held  
- **Rest (4)** – again, silence, but this time it *means* something

**Piano (Diane):**  
- **Chord on beat 2:** G7 (G–B–D–F), open voicing  
- **Chord on beat 4:** Dm7 (D–F–A–C), with a tritone in the left hand (Ab)  
- *She colors it with anger, but also with something unresolved.*

**Bass (Marcus):**  
- **Roots and fifths:** Bb (1), F (2), D (3), A (4)  
- **Chromatic approach on beat 4:** B (chromatic lead into C)  
- *He walks, but he knows the answer is coming.*

**Drums (Little Ray):**  
- **Kick:** 1, 3  
- **Snare:** 2, 4  
- **Hi-hat:** every 8th (closed, but getting more aggressive)  
- *The tension is building.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Resolution (and the question answered)**  
**Tenor Sax (Dante):**  
- **Rest (1)** – silence again, but this time it’s *tense*  
- **D4 (2)** – long, open, and high  
- **F4 (3)** – short, sharp, like a beat  
- **C4 (4)** – held, fading out  
- *The melody returns, but not the same. A new answer.*

**Piano (Diane):**  
- **Chord on beat 2:** D7 (D–F#–A–C)  
- **Chord on beat 4:** Cm7 (C–Eb–G–Bb), resolving on the last beat  
- *She resolves, but not fully. It’s a question that wants to be asked again.*

**Bass (Marcus):**  
- **Roots and fifths:** D (1), A (2), F (3), C (4)  
- *He ends with the root, grounding the whole thing.*

**Drums (Little Ray):**  
- **Kick:** 1, 3  
- **Snare:** 2, 4  
- **Hi-hat:** every 8th (closed, with a slight decay)  
- *He plays it clean, like the end of a dream.*

### **Final Note:**
The last note of the saxophone is a **C4**, held for half a beat, fading into silence. The bulb flickers again. Wayne Shorter leans forward. He listens. He nods.

This is the start of a story. Not the end.
