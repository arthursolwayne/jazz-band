**Dante Russo – 4-Bar Jazz Intro in D (160 BPM, 4/4)**  
**Key: D minor** (with a touch of ambiguity — the search is in the space between the notes)

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Hi-hat on every eighth note, snare on 2 and 4, kick on 1 and 3.*  
A slow build of tension, like the first breath before a dive.  
Just enough to make you lean in, but not enough to know where it’s going.

---

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp on 2 and 4 with minor 7th chords, walking line in the left hand.*  
**Left hand:**  
`E♭–F–G–A` (chromatic approach to D)  
**Right hand:**  
`Dm7` on beat 2, `G7` on beat 4  
She’s not just playing chords — she’s asking a question.

---

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, chromatic approach to D on beat 1.*  
`C–C♯–D–E♭`  
He’s the anchor, but he’s pulling you forward.

---

**Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Same pattern, but with a subtle fill on the "and" of 3.*  
A hint of something new, a whisper of energy.

---

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Your motif — short, haunting, singing.*  
Play the first four notes of your melody:  
**D – F – G – E♭**  
(Quarter note, quarter note, eighth note, eighth note)  
Let it hang. Space is the rhythm here.

---

**Bar 4 – Full Band:**  
*Marcus continues his walking line, Diane plays a G7 on beat 4, Little Ray fills the bar with hihat and snare.*  
You come back in with the last two notes of the motif:  
**D – F**  
(Quarter note, quarter note)  
It ends on a question. The doorway is open.

---

**The silence after the last note is the moment.**  
That’s when Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
That’s when the music becomes something else.  
That’s when the story begins.
