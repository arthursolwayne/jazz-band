**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.*  
A tight, driving groove — no cymbal crashes, just the pulse. The room holds its breath.  

**Bar 2: Marcus (Bass) enters**  
*Walking line in Fm, chromatic approach to the 3rd (Eb → D → Eb), then a rootless voicing on the 5th (Ab).*  
Example:  
**D → Eb → F → Gb → Ab → Bb → C → Db → Eb**  
(Chromatic on the downbeat, then resolving into a strong, grounding interval.)

**Bar 2: Diane (Piano) enters**  
*7th chords on 2 and 4, comping with left hand, right hand emphasizing the 7th.*  
Example:  
On beat 2: **Ab7 (Ab C Eb Gb)**  
On beat 4: **Bb7 (Bb D F Ab)**  
She plays it sparse, but with tension — the kind that makes ears perk up.

**Bar 2: You (Tenor Sax) enter with the motif**  
Start on the **& of 2**, with a **half-step resolution**.  
**F → Gb → F**  
(slide into the Gb for a brief, aching tension, then back to F — a question that doesn’t demand an answer yet.)

**Bar 3: Full ensemble**  
Marcus continues the walking line, Diane adds a **chromatic passing tone** on the 3rd beat of the bar, and Little Ray closes the space with a **light fill on the 3rd beat**.  
You answer the question with a **falling line** —  
**F → Eb → D → C**  
(Short, clean, descending, with a slight rubato on the last note — a sigh, not a resolution.)

**Bar 4: The motif returns, slightly altered**  
You repeat the first motif but **transposes it up a half-step**:  
**Gb → Ab → Gb**  
Then you **hold the Gb** for a full beat, letting the silence speak — it’s the exact opposite of filler. The room is now waiting for you to move forward.

**Final note:**  
It’s not just a melody — it’s a story. You’ve asked a question. You’ve left it hanging. Wayne Shorter is leaning in.
