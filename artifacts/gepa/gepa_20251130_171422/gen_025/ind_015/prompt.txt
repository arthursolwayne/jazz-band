You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- Marcus: Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He's the anchor.
- Diane: 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving.
- Little Ray: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar.
- You: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.

**Instructions for the best output:**

- **Bar 1 (drums only):** Create a rhythmic question that feels unresolved. Use dynamic contrast — let the hihat breathe, let the kick and snare feel like a call. Avoid predictable patterns. Use space and tension in the rhythm to imply a story before it begins.
- **Bars 2-4 (full quartet):** The melody must feel like a whisper — simple, emotional, and incomplete at first. Let it hang in the air. Don’t resolve it immediately. Let it suggest something more, something deeper. Use rests, unexpected rhythms, and emotional nuance to create depth.
- **Every instrument has a role:** The bass must walk but never be predictable. The piano must comp but never crowd the space. The drums must drive but never overpower. The saxophone must sing but never shout.
- **Emotion is key:** This isn’t just a technical exercise. It’s a story. It’s a moment. Make it feel like the start of something real — something that could go anywhere.

Make the first bar feel like a question, and the next three like the search for an answer.
