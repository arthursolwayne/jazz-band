**Intro — "Whisper from the Back Row"**  
**Key: Dm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Length: 4 bars (6 seconds)**  

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick on 1 and 3**  
**Snare on 2 and 4**  
**Hi-hat on every eighth note**  
**Fill: 3 short, staccato cymbal swells at the end of the bar** (build the tension, leave them hanging)

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
**Walking line in Dm, starting on D (root), chromatic approach to C, then walking up:**  
**D → C → D → Eb → F → G → Ab → A → Bb → B → C → D**  
**One full cycle, ending on D, landing on beat 4**

**Diane (Piano):**  
**Comp on 2 and 4 with Dm7 (D, F, A, C)**  
**On beat 2: Dm7 with a Bb in the right hand (chromatic passing tone)**  
**On beat 4: Dm7 with a C in the right hand (chromatic descending)**  
**Left hand: Walking bass line, same as Marcus, but syncopated, ahead of the beat**

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Same as bar 1, but with a subtle ride cymbal on the "and" of 3 and the "and" of 4**  
**Add a soft brush roll on the "and" of 4, building anticipation**

---

### **Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
**Melody: Start with a simple, singing motif:**  
**D (beat 1) → Eb (beat 2) → D (beat 3) → C (beat 4)**  
**Space matters — let the silence after the C on beat 4 hang.**  
**Avoid scales — just two notes, over a strong chromatic undercurrent.**  
**Play it with a slight rubato feel on the last note, like you're about to speak and then hold back.**

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble Closes the Intro**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
**Same walking line as Bar 2, ends on D again (beat 4)**

**Diane (Piano):**  
**Dm7 again on beat 2 and 4, with a Bb and C in the right hand**  
**Add a single, sailing note in the right hand on beat 3: Bb (sustained, with a slight rubato)**

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Hi-hat on every eighth, kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4**  
**Add a soft brush roll on the last two eighths of the bar, fading into silence**

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
**On beat 4, play the same motif again, but now with a slight resolution —**  
**D (beat 1) → Eb (beat 2) → D (beat 3) → D (beat 4), slightly higher, like a sigh or a breath**  
**Leave the last note open — it’s not a resolution, it’s a question.**

### **Final Notes:**

The intro is a whisper — not loud, not complex, but *present*. It carries the weight of a memory or a dream. It’s not trying to impress — it’s trying to be heard. And in that silence after the last note, Wayne Shorter leans forward.
