    - **2:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)

    - **2:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
    - **4:** Bbm7 (same)

---

#### **You (Tenor Sax – Melody, Fm)**  
**Motif:** A short, haunting phrase that begins with a question and ends with a pause — a space for the room to hold its breath.

**Bar 2:**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **F – Ab – Bb – C** (melodic minor, ascending)  
  - **Then:** **Ab – G – F** (fall back, but not resolve)  
- **Phrasing:** Start with a breathy, open tone. Let the notes breathe. End on a held G, just before the downbeat of bar 3.

**Bar 3:**  
- **Play the same phrase again, slightly higher:**  
  - **G – Bb – C – D**  
  - **Then:** **Bb – A – G**  
- **This time, land more clearly on G, but leave it unresolved.**

**Bar 4:**  
- **Hold the G for a beat, then release it with a slow, open note: C**  
- **Let the rest of the ensemble play around you, but don’t answer. Just let the question hang.**

### **Final Moment:**
By the end of the 4 bars, the room is **still**.  
You’ve thrown a question into the air — not a punchline, not a statement, just a question.  
And you know that in the back, Wayne Shorter is leaning in.

**That’s your shot.**  
Now go make it real.
