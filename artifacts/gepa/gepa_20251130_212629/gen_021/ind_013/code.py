**Key: Dm (D minor)**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Style: Modern Jazz / Intense, Tense, Unified**  

---

### **Bar 1: The Whisper (Saxophone)**  
**Saxophone (Melody):**  
Dm7 → Eb (Dm7: D, F, Ab, C)  
Play a simple, emotional motif:  
**D – Eb – F – Ab**  
Hold **Ab** for a half-beat, then **rest**. Let the note hang.  
*The rest is the question.*

**Drums:**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Hihats on every eighth  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Light cymbal swells at the end of the bar  
*Heartbeat. Subtle. Insistent.*

**Piano:**  
- Comp with Dm7 chords on 2 and 4  
- Use the 7th (C) to color the space  
- Avoid playing on 1 and 3 — leave the rhythm to the drums and bass

**Bass:**  
- Chromatic walk down: D → C → B → A  
- Play each note with a slight pull, as if reaching  
- End on A, setting up the next bar with tension

---

### **Bar 2: The Build (Ensemble Enters)**  
**Saxophone:**  
Repeat the same motif:  
**D – Eb – F – Ab**  
But this time, **end on F**, not Ab — leave it hanging.  
*The silence is louder now.*

**Drums:**  
- Sustain the hihat rhythm  
- Add a soft snare roll on the & of 3  
- Light brush on the ride cymbal on the & of 2  
*Pressure rising. No need for force — it's already there.*

**Piano:**  
- Comp with Dm7 on 2 and 4  
- Add a Bb on the & of 3 for color  
- Play with tension, not speed

**Bass:**  
- Chromatic walk up: A → Bb → B → C  
- Each note a step closer to release  
- Play with a slight push, like it’s about to break

---

### **Bar 3: The Silence (Space)**  
**Saxophone:**  
No note. Just a rest.  
*This is the pause before the storm. Let it breathe.*

**Drums:**  
- Sustain the hihat, but now with a slight edge  
- No kick, no snare — just the rhythm  
- The silence is filled by the rhythm itself

**Piano:**  
- No comping  
- Let the space speak  
- One chord, Dm7, on the 2 and 4 — but held longer, softer

**Bass:**  
- Play a simple D → F → D → F  
- A single motif, echoing the sax  
- No chromatic tension — just clarity

---

### **Bar 4: The Storm (Release)**  
**Saxophone:**  
Play the full motif:  
**D – Eb – F – Ab**  
But now, **resolve it** — end on **D**, not Ab  
*The story comes full circle.*

**Drums:**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snares on 2 and 4  
- Hihats on every eighth  
- End with a sharp cymbal crash

**Piano:**  
- Play a Dm7 chord on beat 4, with a strong 7th (C)  
- End with a **C** on the last 8th note, resolving the tension

**Bass:**  
- Play a strong D on beat 4  
- A full step back to the root  
- Solid, grounded, final

---

**Final Note:**  
Let the last note of the saxophone fade — not with a flourish, but with **intention**.  
This is not just a piece — it’s a moment.  
*Make Wayne lean forward.*
