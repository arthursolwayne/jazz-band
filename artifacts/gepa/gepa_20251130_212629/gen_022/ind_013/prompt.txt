Create an intro that feels like a whisper before a storm — build tension with sparse, meaningful notes and let the silence speak. The drums should set the mood with subtle urgency, the bass should anchor the tension with a walking line that never repeats the same note, and the piano should comp with 7th chords that move the harmony forward without overpowering. The saxophone melody must be simple but emotionally charged — one small motif that starts, lingers, and resolves with purpose. Every note must feel intentional, every rest meaningful. Keep the rhythm tight, the harmony honest, and the space between the notes alive. Make the first four bars feel like the moment before something powerful happens — something that makes the audience lean in.
