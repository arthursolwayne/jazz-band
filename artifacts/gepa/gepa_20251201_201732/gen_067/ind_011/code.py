**Title: "Whispers in the Dark"**  
**Key: Fm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  

---

**BAR 1 (0.0 - 1.5s):**  
**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note, but with a slight lift on 3 and 4, creating a breath before the explosion  
- Leave a half-second of silence after the last snare (beat 4) to stretch the tension  

**BAR 2 (1.5 - 3.0s):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Root on beat 1: F2  
- Chromatic approach to B♭2 on beat 2: E♭2 → F2  
- Root on beat 3: F2  
- Chromatic approach to D♭3 on beat 4: C2 → D♭3  
- Walking line (D2-G2, MIDI 38-43), but with space, not rush  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Bar 2: Fm7 (F, A♭, C, E♭)  
- Bar 3: B♭7 (B♭, D, F, A)  
- Bar 4: D♭7 (D♭, F, A♭, C)  
- Open voicings, spaced out, resolved on beat 4 of bar 4  
- Comp on beats 2 and 4 — the chords are reactive, like a heartbeat  

**BAR 3 (3.0 - 4.5s):**  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Start with a short, whispered motif:  
  - F (beat 1)  
  - A♭ (beat 2)  
  - C (beat 3)  
  - F (beat 4)  
- Let the last note hang — no resolution, just a question  
- Play it with a breathy sound, like a memory trying to speak  

**BAR 4 (4.5 - 6.0s):**  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Return with the same motif, but now with urgency  
  - F (beat 1)  
  - A♭ (beat 2)  
  - C (beat 3)  
  - F (beat 4) — but this time, it’s not just a question — it’s a statement  
- Play it with more weight, more space between the notes — let the silence speak  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Same line as bar 2, but with a slight emphasis on beat 4 (D♭3)  
- The line is now a counterpoint to your melody, not just a background  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Resolve the D♭7 chord  
- Last chord is a sustained C7, open and unresolved — a door left ajar  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth, but now with a slight lift on beat 3 — like a heartbeat  
- End with a soft cymbal crash on beat 4, not too loud, just enough to make the room hold its breath

**Final Thought:**  
It's not about showing off. It's about making someone *feel* something in less than 6 seconds. Wayne Shorter is watching. He's heard it all. But if this intro has the right tension, the right space, the right question — he’ll lean forward. That’s what it takes.  

You start with silence. You end with a question. And that’s enough.
