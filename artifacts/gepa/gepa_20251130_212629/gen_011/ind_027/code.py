**"Whispers in F" – 4-Bar Intro (160 BPM, 4/4, Key of F)**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
A slow, deliberate build.  
- Kick on beat 1 only.  
- Snare on beat 3 only.  
- Hihat on every eighth note, but with a subtle, dry, chamber-like sound — like a whisper in the dark.  
- No cymbal crash. No fill. Just the *sound* of waiting.  
- The silence between the hihats is the real rhythm.

---

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
Marcus enters with a walking line, but it’s not just walking — it’s *haunting*.  
- F – G – Ab – Bb (chromatic approach to Bb)  
- Bb – A – G – F (chromatic approach down to F)  
- Then he holds the F for a full beat.  
- A second later, he does the same line again, but an octave lower.  
- He says nothing, but you can feel him watching you.

---

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
She plays the rhythm of the bass line, but with 7th chords.  
- F7 on beat 2 (F-A-C-E)  
- Bb7 on beat 4 (Bb-D-F-A)  
- She leaves space in between, but the chords are sharp — like she’s already angry.  
- Her left hand plays the walking line in the bass register, but she doesn’t imitate Marcus. She *complements* him. She’s not here to follow. She’s here to *listen*.

---

**Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Now he’s in full motion.  
- Kick on 1 and 3.  
- Snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hihat on every eighth.  
- But there's a slight *swing* on the snare — not straight, not laid-back, but *alive*.  
- The energy is rising, but it's controlled.

---

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
This is the moment.  
You play a short motif — *three notes* — over the F7 chord.  
- F – Bb – G  
- It's not a scale run. It's a question.  
- You play it with a slight delay on the second note — like you're still finding your way.  
- You leave it hanging.  
- The room holds.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.

---

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
She answers with a *chromatic* descending line.  
- Bb – A – G – F – Eb – D  
- It's not resolution. It's *fear* of resolution.  
- She plays it with fire, but also with restraint.

---

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
He walks through the line again, but this time he adds a *half-step* chromatic approach on the G.  
- F – G – Ab – G – F  
- It’s a subtle shift, but it makes the harmony *breathe*.

---

**Bar 3 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
He plays a fill on the last two beats, but it's not flashy. It's *urgent*.  
- A quick roll on the snare, then a sharp hihat on the "and" of 3.  
- It's not a solo. It's a *prelude*.

---

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
You come back on the last beat.  
- Just one note: G.  
- Sustained.  
- You don’t play the rest.  
- You let it hang.  
- You let the silence do the work.

---

**Bar 4 – Diane (Piano):**  
She plays a single, dissonant chord: G7sus4.  
- A chord that wants to resolve but can’t.  
- It’s the sound of a door opening halfway.

---

**Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass):**  
He holds the F for the full bar — a half-note — and then slides up to G on the last eighth.  
- He says nothing, but he knows what’s coming.

---

**Bar 4 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
He ends the bar with a *single* snare hit on beat 4.  
- No hihat. No cymbal.  
- Just the sound of a heartbeat.

---

**Final Silence:**  
For a full two beats, there's nothing.  
No bass, no piano, no drums.  
Just the air.  
Just the music that’s not yet played.  
Just the sound of a man who’s about to change everything.

---

**That’s the intro.**  
Now, Wayne Shorter is listening.  
And he’s waiting to hear what you do next.
