**Title: "At the Threshold"**  
**Key: Fm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Mood: Tense, searching, with a hint of memory**

---

### **BAR 1 – Drums (Little Ray)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every 8th note (but with a slight *dynamics shift* in the second half of the bar)  
**Fill:** A very subtle *brushed ride cymbal* on beat 4, just before the snare — not a crash, just a whisper of texture.  
**Dynamics:** Start with a soft, almost *distant* sound, like a memory echoing. Build a little in the second half of the bar, but never loud.

---

### **BAR 2 – Bass (Marcus)**  
**Line:**  
C#7 (Fm7) – Bb (chromatic approach to A) – A (Fm7) – G (Fm7)  
**Dynamics:** Start with a soft, warm tone, then a slight *push* on the A.  
**Rhythm:** Even eighth notes, but with a *rubato* feel on the last note — a tiny hesitation.

---

### **BAR 2 – Piano (Diane)**  
**Comping:**  
On beat 2: E♭7 (Fm7 chord)  
On beat 4: A♭7 (Fm7 chord)  
**Left hand:** Chromatic descent from C# to Bb on beat 2, then a rest on beat 4.  
**Right hand:** A single A on beat 2, held with a slight rubato.  
**Emotion:** This is anger, but not loud — it's a quiet, burning resolve.

---

### **BAR 2 – Sax (You)**  
**Motif:**  
Start on beat 2, with a single note: **A (Fm7)**  
Hold it for just a hair over a beat, then rest on beat 3.  
**Dynamics:** Soft, almost like a whisper — but with *bite*.

---

### **BAR 3 – Drums (Little Ray)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every 8th  
**Fill:** A *light rimshot* on beat 3, just before the kick. No crash, no drama — just a subtle *push*.  
**Dynamics:** Slightly louder than bar 1, but not aggressive.

---

### **BAR 3 – Bass (Marcus)**  
**Line:**  
A – G – F – E♭ (Fm7)  
**Rhythm:** Even eighth notes  
**Dynamics:** Slight emphasis on the F — a *pause* in the tension.  
**Emotion:** This is *melodic* walking — not just a rhythm section. It’s a story being told.

---

### **BAR 3 – Piano (Diane)**  
**Comping:**  
Beat 1: Fm7  
Beat 3: A♭7  
**Left hand:** A chromatic walk from G to E♭  
**Right hand:** A single E♭ on beat 3, with a slight *sustain*  
**Emotion:** This is the *search* — the tension, the longing.

---

### **BAR 3 – Sax (You)**  
**Motif:**  
Start on beat 1 with **C# (Fm7)**  
Then **A (Fm7)** on beat 2  
Hold it, **rest** on beat 3  
Then **F (Fm7)** on beat 4  
**Dynamics:** Build up in the last half of the bar — a *question* ending.

---

### **BAR 4 – Drums (Little Ray)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every 8th  
**Fill:** A *brushed snare roll* into beat 1  
**Dynamics:** Build to a *soft but present* peak — no explosion, just a *presence*.

---

### **BAR 4 – Bass (Marcus)**  
**Line:**  
E♭ – D – C# – Bb (Fm7)  
**Rhythm:** Even eighth notes  
**Dynamics:** Slight emphasis on the Bb — a *return* to a familiar sound  
**Emotion:** This is the *anchor* — the place you come back to.

---

### **BAR 4 – Piano (Diane)**  
**Comping:**  
Beat 1: Fm7  
Beat 2: E♭7  
Beat 3: A♭7  
Beat 4: Fm7  
**Left hand:** Chromatic walk from E♭ to Bb  
**Right hand:** A single Bb on beat 4, held with *sustained emotion*  
**Emotion:** This is the *end of the search* — a resolution, but not a conclusion.

---

### **BAR 4 – Sax (You)**  
**Motif:**  
Start on beat 1 with **F (Fm7)**  
Then **A (Fm7)** on beat 2  
Then **C# (Fm7)** on beat 3  
Then **F (Fm7)** on beat 4  
**Dynamics:** Build to a *soft but resonant* finish — the *answer* is still open.

---

### **Final Note**  
This is not a typical intro. It’s a *moment* — a question in the first bar, a search in the next three, and an open ending that invites Wayne to lean forward. You’re not just playing a tune, you’re telling a story. And if he listens, he’ll hear something in that first phrase that only a man who’s walked the same road would understand.
