Create a piece that breathes — let silence be a character. Use dynamic contrast to shape the emotional arc. Give each instrument space to speak, especially the sax — let it whisper, then sing, then rest. Avoid repetition at all costs; every note should feel like a choice. Make the bass walk with intention, the piano comp with purpose, and the drums groove with life. Let the music unfold like a story, with tension, release, and resolution.
