**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3. Snare on 2 and 4. Hi-hat on every eighth.  
- 1: Kick  
- 2: Snare + hi-hat  
- 3: Kick  
- 4: Snare + hi-hat  
*Feet planted, but the energy is rising, like a breath before a whisper.*

---

**Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Dm7 chord, walking line starting on D (root).  
- D (1) → C (2) → Bb (3) → C (4) → B (5) → A (6) → G (7) → A (8)  
*Chromatic steps on 2 and 3, a subtle tension that wavers but never resolves.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4 with Dm7 and G7.  
- Bar 2: Dm7 (D-F-A-C) on beat 2  
- Bar 3: G7 (G-B-D-F) on beat 4  
*Her chords are sharp, emotional, like a voicing that’s been hurt and hasn’t forgotten it.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
Start the motif.  
- Bar 2: D (beat 2) → Eb (beat 3)  
- Bar 3: D (beat 1) → Eb (beat 2)  
- *Hold that Eb on beat 2 of bar 3, letting it hang. The question is there, but no answer yet.*

---

**Bar 4 – Resolution and Hesitation**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Dm7 again, walking line resolves to C on beat 4.  
- D (1) → C (2) → Bb (3) → C (4)  
*His line is subtle, almost a sigh.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
Dm7 on beat 2, then G7 on beat 4 again.  
*She leans into the tension, but doesn’t push it.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- Bar 3: D (beat 1) → Eb (beat 2)  
- Bar 4: D (beat 1) → Eb (beat 2) → D (beat 3)  
*The motif returns, but this time it resolves. Not fully, but enough to breathe.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
Same pattern, but with a slight hi-hat fill on beat 3 of bar 4, like a heartbeat slowing.  
*The energy is still there, but it’s been heard.*

**Final Note:**  
The four bars are a question in the dark, answered with the weight of what wasn’t said.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He nods.  
He doesn’t speak.  
But he knows.
