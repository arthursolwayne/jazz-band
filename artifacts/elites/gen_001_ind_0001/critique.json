  "rationale": "This arrangement lacks essential jazz elements. The piano plays simple triads (C-E-G, D-F-A, etc.) without 7th chords or extensions, which is fundamental to jazz harmony. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat only occasionally hitting upbeats. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The trumpet is completely silent throughout, and there's no call-and-response or interplay between instruments. The feel is overly academic and lacks the spontaneity and sophistication of true jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz harmonic sophistication",
    "Add chromatic approach notes and blues inflections to the saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in the hihat pattern and add syncopated accents on the snare for authentic Latin jazz feel"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Mandate the use of 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section, and specify ii-V-I progressions. Add examples of bebop phrasing patterns and Latin jazz rhythmic motifs."
