---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Set the scene.*  
- **Kick:** On **1** and **3**  
- **Snare:** On **2** and **4**  
- **Hi-hat:** On every 8th note (steady, but not loud)  
- **Fill:** A light brush stroke on the offbeat of **& of 3**, subtle, like a whisper  
- **Feel:** Tense but controlled, like the edge of a storm  

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters (Marcus, Diane, Dante):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Walking line in F major**, chromatic passing tones  
- **Notes:** **F – G – G# – A – Bb – B – C – C# – D – Eb – E – F**  
- **Rhythm:** Quarter notes, with a slight push on **& of 2** and **& of 4**  
- **Purpose:** Anchor the harmony, but with subtle tension  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4:**  
  - **Bar 2:** **F7** (F A C Eb)  
  - **Bar 3:** **Bb7** (Bb D F Ab)  
  - **Bar 4:** **Eb7** (Eb G Bb Db)  
- **Voice leading:** Smooth, with a slight dissonance on the **Ab** in the **Bb7**  
- **Left hand:** Walking bass line, but not too busy — just enough to drive the rhythm  

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:** One phrase, haunting and unresolved  
- **Notes (melody, written in F major):**  
  - **Bar 2:** **F – G – Bb – A – G – F**  
    - **Phrase:** F (long), G (legato), Bb (sigh), A (fall), G (tense), F (rest)  
    - **Rhythm:** **& of 1 – 2 – & of 2 – 3 – & of 3 – 4**  
    - **Pause on beat 4** — leave it hanging  

---

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano) and Marcus (Bass) continue:**  
- **Marcus:** Follows the same walking line, but with a slight **A** in the **C#** place to add tension  
- **Diane:** Comp with **Bb7** again, but this time with a **D** in the left hand, **Ab** in the right — a **tritone substitution**  
- **Dante:** Silence.  
  - **Bar 3:** You breathe, hold the space, let the tension build  
  - **Think:** Wayne Shorter’s eyes narrow. He leans in.

### **Bar 4 – Resolution (Dante, Diane, Marcus):**  
**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Phrase:** **F – G – Bb – A – C**  
- **Rhythm:** **1 – 2 – & of 2 – 3 – & of 3**  
- **Feel:** The resolution comes not to **F**, but to **C** — a **subdominant** rather than a tonic  
- **End on a C**, held for a half-beat, then release  
- **Purpose:** Not what he expects — it’s not a resolution, it’s a question

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on beat 4:** **C7** (C E G Bb)  
- **Voice leading:** Smooth into the **C**  
- **Left hand:** A **F** on the downbeat, **C** on **& of 4** — a **chromatic descent**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Ends on a C**, held a little longer than expected  
- **Subtle push on the last note** — like a breath held

---

### **Final Feel:**  
- **Tension:** Built through space, not noise  
- **Harmony:** Rich but not busy, rooted in F, but questioning the tonic  
- **Melody:** Haunting, unresolved, and intentional  
- **Purpose:** You don’t *answer* the question — you *raise* it.  

Wayne Shorter nods.  
He knows it’s not over.  
And that’s the point.
