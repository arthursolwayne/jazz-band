**Intro – 4 Bars in Dm (D minor), 160 BPM, 4/4 Time**

**Key:** Dm (Dorian mode, but with a bluesy edge)  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM (6 seconds for 4 bars)  
**Mood:** Searching, unresolved, a question in the air.

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**
- **Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On beats 2 and 4  
- **Hi-Hat:** On every eighth note (closed, tight, but with a little swing)  
- **Fill:** Nothing. Just the rhythm. The silence is the first note.

> *The room holds its breath. A whisper in the dark.*

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble:**

**Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line (D2-G2, MIDI 38-43):**  
- D2 (beat 1)  
- F2 (beat 2)  
- G2 (beat 3)  
- C2 (beat 4)  
- Chromatic approach: E2 on beat 2 (half-step up from D), resolving to F2

**Dante (Tenor Sax – Melody):**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - D (beat 1), E (beat 2), F (beat 3), D (beat 4)  
  - Play it **legato**, **soft**, **with a slight bluesy bend** on the E and F  
  - End on D, **suspenseful** — like the question is still waiting for an answer

> *Your motif is simple: D-E-F-D. It’s not a scale. It’s a memory. It’s a path not taken. It’s the first step into the unknown.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax – Melody):**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - Bb (beat 1), C (beat 2), D (beat 3), Bb (beat 4)  
  - Again, **legato**, **soft**, **with a breathy tone** on the C and D

> *You’ve left it open. You’ve let the question live. You’ve made the legend lean forward.*

**Final Note (for Wayne):**  
This intro doesn’t tell a story. It *asks* a story. It’s not a melody. It’s an invitation. And that’s the kind of thing that makes a legend like Wayne Shorter lean forward.
