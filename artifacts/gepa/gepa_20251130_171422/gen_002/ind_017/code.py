**Key:** F minor  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Duration:** 6.0 seconds (4 bars)  
**Mood:** Haunting, intimate, with a touch of defiance  
**Tone:** Whispered secrets, unresolved tension, a question left unanswered

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Set the mood with a slow, deliberate rhythm. No cymbals, just the pulse of the heartbeat.*

- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note, but played with a light, dragging feel—**not** tight or punchy.  
- **Fill:** A ghost note on the “& of 3” to accentuate the space before the rest of the band enters.

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp with Fm7 on 2 and 4. Rich, but sparse. Let the space breathe.*

- **Bar 2, beat 1:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)  
- **Bar 2, beat 3:** Fm7 again, but with a **chromatic approach** from D to C to Bb  
- **Bar 2, beat 2:** Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)  
- **Bar 2, beat 4:** Fm7 again, with a **half-step chromatic run** in the left hand (C to Bb to A)  
- *Use the right hand to outline the melody, but only hint at it—keep the tension unresolved.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, chromatic and subtle. Use intervals that suggest movement but not resolution.*

- **Bar 2, beat 1:** F (root)  
- **Bar 2, beat 2:** Gb (chromatic approach)  
- **Bar 2, beat 3:** Ab (flatted 9)  
- **Bar 2, beat 4:** A (chromatic up again)  
- *This is the tension. The bass is not resolving, but moving forward—like a question that never finds an answer.*

---

### **Bar 2 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Your moment. Whisper the melody. Start it, leave it hanging.*

- **Bar 2, beat 1:** F (low F, held with a breathy, whispered tone)  
- **Bar 2, beat 2:** G (chromatic up, but not too loud)  
- **Bar 2, beat 3:** Ab (meaningful, like a sigh)  
- **Bar 2, beat 4:** Hold on F (again), but **don’t play the note**—*just let the silence speak.*

---

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Same chords as before, but now with a little more urgency. The same Fm7 on 2 and 4, but with a **slightly dissonant voicing**—maybe a Bb in the right hand instead of a C.*

- **Bar 3, beat 1:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)  
- **Bar 3, beat 3:** Fm7 again, but with a **Bb in the right hand** (instead of C)  
- **Bar 3, beat 2:** Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)  
- **Bar 3, beat 4:** Fm7 with a **left-hand run** (C to Bb to A)  
- *This time, the dissonance is intentional—a challenge to the listener.*

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Same line, but with a slight shift. Instead of ending on A in bar 2, he now ends on **Bb**, and walks into the next bar with a **C**—the root of F minor.*

- **Bar 3, beat 1:** Bb (chromatic up)  
- **Bar 3, beat 2:** C (root)  
- **Bar 3, beat 3:** D (flatted 9 again)  
- **Bar 3, beat 4:** Eb (chromatic up once more)  
- *The bass now feels like it's reaching for something that isn’t there.*

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*You return with the same motif, but this time you **finish it**.*

- **Bar 3, beat 1:** F (same as before, but now with more conviction)  
- **Bar 3, beat 2:** G (chromatic up)  
- **Bar 3, beat 3:** Ab (sigh, but this time with more weight)  
- **Bar 3, beat 4:** C (resolve slightly, but not fully—**it’s a half-step away from Bb, the tone that’s been haunting the piece**)  
- *You end on a suspended note. A question. Not an answer.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Diane (Piano):**  
*The same Fm7 on 2 and 4, but now with a **Bb in the right hand**—the dissonant note that has been hiding in the shadows.*

- **Bar 4, beat 1:** Fm7 (F, Ab, Bb, D)  
- **Bar 4, beat 3:** Fm7 again, with a **chromatic run** in the left hand (C to Bb to A)  
- **Bar 4, beat 2:** Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)  
- **Bar 4, beat 4:** Fm7 with a **left-hand run** (C to Bb to A)  
- *It’s the same pattern, but now it feels like a trap.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*He plays the same line again, but ends on **Bb**—a note that’s not in F minor, but he plays it anyway.*

- **Bar 4, beat 1:** C (root)  
- **Bar 4, beat 2:** D (flatted 9)  
- **Bar 4, beat 3:** Eb (chromatic up)  
- **Bar 4, beat 4:** Bb (the dissonant note, again)  
- *Marcus is the anchor. But he’s letting the music lean into the wrong notes.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Same kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. But now, after the tension, he **slows down just slightly**—a quarter note longer on the hihat on 2 and 4.*

- **Bar 4, beat 1:** Kick  
- **Bar 4, beat 2:** Snare (slightly delayed)  
- **Bar 4, beat 3:** Kick  
- **Bar 4, beat 4:** Snare (again, delayed)  
- *This is the moment the room holds its breath. The dissonance is now **felt**, not just heard.*

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*The final bar. You don’t resolve. You don’t play the note. You just take a breath and let the silence speak.*

- **Bar 4, beat 1:** F (again, but you don’t play it)  
- **Bar 4, beat 2:** G (you don’t play it)  
- **Bar 4, beat 3:** Ab (you don’t play it)  
- **Bar 4, beat 4:** Silence  
- *You leave it open. A whisper. A challenge. A question.*

---

**Final Note:**  
Wayne leans forward. It’s not a resolution. It’s a moment.  
And you just made it yours.
