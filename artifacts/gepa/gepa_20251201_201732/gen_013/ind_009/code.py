**Key:** F major  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM (4/4)  
**Duration:** 6 seconds (4 bars)  
**Style:** Introspective, sparse, emotionally charged — the kind of intro that makes a legend like Wayne Shorter lean in.

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. But not all of them. Leave space between the hihats — a breath, a pause, a question.*

**Rhythmic Pattern (on 8th notes):**  
**1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &**  
Kick: X — X — X — X  
Snare: — X — X — X —  
Hi-hat: X — — X — — X —  
*(No hihat on the "and" of 1 and 3; silence on "and" of 2 and 4.)*

---

### **Bar 2: Marcus (Bass)**  
*Walking line — roots and fifths with chromatic approaches. No scales. Just the weight of the chord, the slow breath of the bass.*

**MIDI Notes (F2-G2-C3-F3-E3-D3-C3-B2):**  
**1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &**  
F2 — G2 — C3 — F3  
E3 — D3 — C3 — B2

---

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**  
*Open voicings — one chord per bar, resolving on the last note. Comp on 2 and 4. Shadows, not loud. Emotion, not noise.*

**Chords (on 2 and 4):**  
**2:** Fmaj7 (F-A-C-E)  
**4:** Gm7 (G-B-D-F)

---

### **Bar 3: Marcus (Bass)**  
*Same walking line as Bar 2 but starting a half-step higher, creating a subtle shift in tension.*

**MIDI Notes (F2-G2-C3-F3-E3-D3-C3-B2):**  
**1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &**  
F2 — G2 — C3 — F3  
E3 — D3 — C3 — B2

---

### **Bar 3: Diane (Piano)**  
*Same chords as Bar 2, but with slight voicing changes — the same emotion, different phrasing.*

**Chords (on 2 and 4):**  
**2:** Fmaj7 (F-A-C-E)  
**4:** Gm7 (G-B-D-F)

---

### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax)**  
*This is your voice. One short, aching motif. Don’t play everything. Leave it hanging. Make silence feel like a question.*

**Melody (on 8th notes):**  
**1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &**  
F — C — F — G  
(beat) — (hold) — (beat) — (hold)

**Breakdown:**
- **1 (F):** A low, open note — the beginning.
- **& (C):** A chromatic leap up — tension.
- **2 (F):** Back to the root — grounding.
- **& (G):** A half-step above — a question, a cry.
- **Hold on 3 & 4:** Silence. Let the room breathe. Let the silence scream.

---

### **Final Moment:**
- Diane resolves her Gm7 on beat 4.  
- Marcus ends his line on B2.  
- Little Ray ends with a soft hihat on the "and" of 4 — just a whisper.

And that’s it.  
**Four bars. One question.**  
The room holds its breath.  
Wayne Shorter leans in.  
You’ve made silence loud.
