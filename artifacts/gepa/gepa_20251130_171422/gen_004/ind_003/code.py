**Title: "Unspoken"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Bars: 1–4**  
**Style: Modern Post-Bop / Contemporary Jazz**  
**Mood: A question, not an answer. A whisper that lingers.**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth  
**Fill:** One open hi-hat on the "&" of 3  
**Feel:** Tense, urgent, but not frantic. The energy is building, but there’s a hush in the room. Wayne leans in.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

#### **Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line (F Major scale with chromatic approaches)**  
**Notes:**  
F – G – G# – A – A – Bb – Bb – C  
**Rhythm:**  
Downbeat on 1, 2, 3, 4  
**Subtle:** On the "and" of 2, a chromatic approach to Bb  
**Purpose:** Provide a steady, shifting undercurrent. The listener feels pulled forward.

#### **Diane (Piano) – Comping on 2 and 4, 7th chords, space between**  
**Bar 2 (on 2 and 4):**  
**2:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
**4:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
**Space:** No notes on 1 and 3. Let the silence breathe. Let the question hang.

### **Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax) – Melody (Motif)**

**Phrase:**  
**Note values:** Quarter note – eighth note – eighth note – quarter note  
**Notes:**  
F – D – C – F  
**Dynamics:**  
**F** – **mf**, **D** – **pp**, **C** – **mp**, **F** – **mf**  
**Articulation:**  
F: Legato, D: Staccato, C: Slight portamento, F: Legato again  
**Purpose:** This is the question. It’s not a scale run. It’s a phrase that asks something. It’s open-ended, unresolved, but full of tension.

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble – Resolution (But Not Answered)**

#### **Marcus (Bass):**  
**Notes:**  
F – G – G# – A  
**Rhythm:**  
Same as bar 2  
**Subtle:** On the "and" of 4, a half-step approach to A

#### **Diane (Piano):**  
**On 2 and 4:**  
**2:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
**4:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
Same as bar 2 — no change. The chords remain in place, offering no resolution.

#### **Little Ray (Drums):**  
Same feel as bar 1 — kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth  
**Fill:** One muted tom on the "&" of 4  
**Energy:** Same urgency, same tension — a moment that lingers.

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
**Notes:**  
F – D – C – rest  
**Dynamics:**  
Same as bar 3, but the last note is left **unplayed**  
**Purpose:** The question is left unanswered. The listener is held in suspense. Wayne Shorter — he leans forward.

### **Final Moment:**

The room is silent for a beat — no applause, no reaction. Just the sound of the cellar, the hum of a neon sign, the memory of a phrase that was never completed.

But you know — this is the intro that stays with him. The one that lingers.

**End of Intro.**  
**Next bar: The rest of the song begins.**
