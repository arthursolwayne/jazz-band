  "rationale": "This arrangement lacks essential jazz elements. The piano uses basic triads (C-E-G, D-F-A, etc.) without 7th chords or extensions, which is not jazz harmony. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat hitting only on the 'and' of 2 and 4 inconsistently. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks blues inflection or bebop vocabulary. The trumpet is silent throughout, and there's no interplay or call-and-response between instruments. The overall feel is mechanical and lacks the soul and sophistication of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes and enclosures to the saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce more syncopation in the hihat pattern with emphasis on upbeats",
    "Add walking bass lines outlining roots, 3rds, 5ths, and 7ths instead of just root notes",
    "Include the trumpet in the arrangement with melodic lines that interact with the saxophone"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Mandate the use of 7th chords in the piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, and require a swing feel in the rhythm section with more syncopation. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns to guide the composer."
