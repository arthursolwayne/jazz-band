**Improved Prompt:**

You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

**Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s):**  
Little Ray is alone. Use the drums to set the tone — create tension, space, and a rhythmic question. Let the hihat breathe, and make the kick and snare feel like a question. Avoid formulaic patterns. Let the rhythm breathe, not just drive.

**Bars 2-4 (1.5 - 6.0s):**  
Everyone joins in. You take the melody. Make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it — but don’t be predictable. Use rests and unexpected rhythms to create emotional depth. Make the melody feel like it’s searching for something. Let the bass anchor it with chromatic movement, the piano comp with sharp, emotional chords, and the drums fill the space with energy and contrast.

**Rules:**
- **Drums:** Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Use dynamic variation and rhythmic contrast. Let the hihat breathe, and make the kick and snare feel like a question.
- **Bass:** Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He's the anchor.
- **Piano:** 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving. Let the emotion come through.
- **Sax:** This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.

**Goal:**  
Create a compelling, emotionally charged opening that hints at a deeper story — not just rhythm, but tension, space, and a melody that lingers. Use dynamic variation, rhythmic contrast, and avoid predictable patterns. Make the first bar feel like a question, and the next three like the search for an answer. Let the music breathe. Let it mean something.
