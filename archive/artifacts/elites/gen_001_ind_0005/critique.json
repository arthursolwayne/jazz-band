  "rationale": "This 8-bar arrangement uses triads exclusively (capped jazz_harmony at 3/10) with no 7th chords or functional jazz harmony. The hihat plays only on downbeats (capped latin_jazz_rhythm at 3/10) with no upbeat syncopation, creating a straight-time feel rather than a Latin jazz groove. The saxophone melody (6/10) uses the C major scale with some rests but lacks phrasing and melodic development. The interplay is weak (4/10) with all instruments starting together in bar 1, and the piano plays constant block chords without rests. The overall feel is academic and lacks the groove, spontaneity, and sophistication that define jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Bar 1: ONLY hihat should play. All other instruments rest.",
    "Bars 2-4: Add snare and bass. Piano and sax still rest.",
    "Bars 5-8: Full ensemble enters with piano 7th chords and memorable sax melody.",
    "Replace ALL piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7: C-E-G-B, Dm7: D-F-A-C)",
    "Increase hihat upbeat syncopation to >60% (hit more 'and's, skip more downbeats)"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize progressive arrangement structure more strongly. Add quantitative requirements: Bar 1 = hihat ONLY, Bars 2-4 = rhythm section ONLY (no piano/sax), Bars 5-8 = full ensemble. Make it impossible to ignore."
