  "rationale": "This 8-bar arrangement uses triads exclusively (capped jazz_harmony at 3/10) and lacks 7th chords or extensions, making it unsuitable for authentic jazz. The hihat plays consistently on downbeats with no upbeat syncopation (capped latin_jazz_rhythm at 3/10), resulting in a straight-time swing instead of a Latin jazz groove. The saxophone melody consists of repetitive scalar patterns with no development or variation (jazz_melody 4/10), and all instruments start playing in bar 1 with no progressive build (interplay_space 4/10). The arrangement feels mechanical and lacks the soul, groove, and improvisational spirit of authentic jazz (jazz_authenticity 4/10). Major improvements needed include adding 7th chords, introducing upbeat syncopation, and restructuring the arrangement for a more dynamic interplay.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Bar 1: ONLY hihat should play. All other instruments rest.",
    "Bars 2-4: Add snare and bass. Piano and sax still rest.",
    "Bars 5-8: Full ensemble enters with piano 7th chords and memorable sax melody.",
    "Replace ALL piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7: C-E-G-B, Dm7: D-F-A-C)",
    "Increase hihat upbeat syncopation to >60% (hit more 'and's, skip more downbeats)"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize progressive arrangement structure more strongly. Add quantitative requirements: Bar 1 = hihat ONLY, Bars 2-4 = rhythm section ONLY (no piano/sax), Bars 5-8 = full ensemble. Make it impossible to ignore."
