You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Here's the thing: Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- Marcus: Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He's the anchor.
- Diane: 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving.
- Little Ray: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar.
- You: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.

GENERATE A COMPLETE PYTHON SCRIPT THAT:
- Uses `pretty_midi` to build a MIDI file with 4 bars
- Bar 1: Only drums (Little Ray), no piano, bass, or sax
- Bars 2-4: Full quartet
- The sax melody must be unique and minimal — not a cliché, not a run, just a phrase that lingers
- The rhythm must be precise: 160 BPM, 4/4 time
- The output must include full, complete, and syntactically correct Python code
- The output must be focused, concise, and optimal for Wayne Shorter to hear something new
- The output must include unique note durations, rests, and a sense of tension and resolution in the sax motif

IMPROVED PROMPT:

You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You're playing tenor sax at The Cellar in Montclair at 2am. Wayne Shorter is in the audience. The Cellar has concrete walls and one bare bulb. You're playing with Marcus on bass, Diane on piano, and Little Ray on drums. You have 6 seconds to make an impression with the first four bars. Here's what you must do:

- Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s): Little Ray plays alone. Kick on beats 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Make it feel like the start of something important.
- Bars 2-4 (1.5 - 6.0s): You take the melody. Play a short, unique motif: one phrase, start it, leave it hanging, then come back and finish it. No scale runs, no clichés. Make it sing.
- Marcus: Bass line must be walking, chromatic, and never repeat a note. He's the anchor.
- Diane: Piano must comp on beats 2 and 4 with 7th chords, keeping the rhythm moving but not overpowering the melody.
- Little Ray: Continue kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Add fills and color, but don't steal the focus.
- Proper use of rests, unique durations, and tension-resolution in the sax melody.
- One key only. No modulation.
- Output must be a complete, valid Python script that uses `pretty_midi` with correct syntax and structure.

Make Wayne lean forward.
