**Title: "Questions in the Dark"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick: 1 & 3**  
**Snare: 2 & 4**  
**Hi-hat: On every eighth note, ghosted on 3 & 7 (check the grid)**  
**Feel:** Urgent but controlled. The kick is sharp, the snare tight. The hi-hat is a pulse, not a fill.  
**Rests:** No cymbal crashes. No fills. Just the pulse.  
**Purpose:** Make them wait. The room holds its breath.

### **Bar 2: Everyone In**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- F2 (MIDI 53) on 1  
- C3 (MIDI 58) on 2  
- F2 on 3  
- B♭2 (MIDI 57) on 4  
**Line:** F – C – F – B♭  
**Approach:** Chromatic on the B♭ (C♭ → B♭), subtle, like a shadow passing.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 2:** C7 (F, A, C, E)  
- **Bar 3:** G7 (G, B, D, F)  
- **Bar 4:** C7 (F, A, C, E)  
**Style:** Open voicings, no root on the first beat. Comp only on 2 and 4.  
**Mood:** Restless, like a memory surfacing.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same pattern as in Bar 1, but with a slight push on 3, just enough to make the bass respond.

---

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif:**  
- F (beat 1)  
- G (beat 2, tied)  
- F (beat 3, tied)  
- B♭ (beat 4, open, unresolved)  
**Phrasing:** A short phrase, like a question. Let it hang.  
**Tone:** Warm, but edgy. Like the first note of a story you can't finish.  
**Rest:** No continuation. The room waits.

---

### **Bar 4: Everyone In**  
**Marcus:**  
- F2 (beat 1)  
- C3 (beat 2)  
- F2 (beat 3)  
- E2 (beat 4, chromatic approach to F)  
**Line:** F – C – F – E (chromatic resolution)

**Diane:**  
- **Bar 4:** A7 (A, C#, E, G)  
- **Resolution:** E in the bass, G in the upper voice.  
- **Mood:** It tightens, like a door closing.

**Little Ray:**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat still on every eighth, but subtly slower, like the ending of a breath.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Return to the motif but now **finish it**.  
- F (beat 1)  
- G (beat 2, tied)  
- F (beat 3, tied)  
- **B♭ (beat 4, resolved — or is it?)**  
- Let the last note linger, just a split second longer.  
- Let the silence speak.

### **Summary of the Moment:**

- Bar 1: A heartbeat.  
- Bar 2: A question begins to form.  
- Bar 3: The question is spoken, but not answered.  
- Bar 4: The answer is hinted at — or maybe it's a new question.

Wayne Shorter leans forward. He's heard something new — something that feels like a memory he didn't know he had. The room is quiet now, but it’s not empty. It’s waiting.

And you feel it.
