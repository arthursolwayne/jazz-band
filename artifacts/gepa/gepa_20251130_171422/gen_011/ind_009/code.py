**Intro – 4 Bars in Dm (D minor), 160 BPM, 4/4 Time**

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Rhythm:** Taut, urgent, minimalist.  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hats:** On every 8th note  
- **Fill:** A subtle brush stroke on the snare at the end of the bar, almost like a heartbeat.  
- **Feel:** Not loose, not tight — like the edge of a knife. The tension is building, but it’s waiting for the next bar to do something.

### **Bar 2: Everyone Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Line:** Dm7 walking line with chromatic approach  
  - D → C → B → C# → D → Eb → D → C  
  - *Subtle grace notes on the downbeats, not just walking. It feels like a memory, but not a memory you can name.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp:** Dm7 on beat 2, Eb7 on beat 4  
- **Chords:**  
  - **Beat 2:** Dm7 (D F A C)  
  - **Beat 4:** Eb7 (Eb G Bb D)  
- **Emotion:** The chords are not just functional — they’re emotional. Think of Diane’s fingers as reaching toward something unresolved. The piano is pulling the melody in, like a tide.

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Melody:** A short, searching motif that lingers.  
- **Notes:** D → F → E → D (half note on D, then a quick run up to F and back down to E, resolving on D)  
- **Phrasing:** Start with a breathy, open D, then move into the F with a slight push. The E is a hesitation — a question. The D at the end is not a resolution, but a return. It’s like the beginning of a story, not the end.  
- **Feel:** Whispered, urgent, not played — *felt*. The saxophone is not showing off, it’s listening.

### **Bar 4: Collective Pulse**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Line:** Dm7 walking line, but with a slight shift  
  - D → Eb → D → C → D → Eb → F → Eb  
  - The line moves in and out, almost dissonant, but sharp and clean. It's not just walking — it's *thinking*.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp:** Dm7 on beat 2, G7 on beat 4  
  - **Beat 2:** Dm7 (D F A C)  
  - **Beat 4:** G7 (G B D F)  
- **Emotion:** The G7 is a pivot, a turn. It’s not the resolution, but it’s a *doorway*. The chords are pushing the melody forward, not holding it back.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick:** 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hats:** Every 8th  
- **Fill:** A soft brush on the snare, just before the end of the bar. It’s not a crash — it’s a question mark.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Final note:** A sustained D, open and wide, held just a beat longer than it should be.  
- **Feel:** The note is not a resolution — it’s an invitation. You’re not telling Shorter what to expect. You’re letting him wonder.

### **End of Intro**

You finish on a D, open and raw. The room is quiet. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The story has just begun.

You’ve got 160 BPM, 4 bars, one key, and one moment. You made it count.
