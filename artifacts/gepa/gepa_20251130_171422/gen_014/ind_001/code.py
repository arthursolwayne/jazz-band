**Title: "Whisper in the Cellar"**  
**Key: Fm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick on 1 and 3**  
**Snare on 2 and 4**  
**Hi-hat on every eighth**  
**Fill:** On the & of 3, a sharp, staccato rimshot, like a heartbeat.  
**Feeling:** Suspense, like the door creaks open just a crack.

---

### **Bar 2 – Everyone in**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Starts with a walking line in Fm.  
**Fm7** -> **G♭m7** -> **A♭7** -> **B♭m7**  
**Line:**  
F - G♭ - A♭ - B♭ (chromatic approach to B♭)  
Then: B♭ - A♭ - G♭ - F (descending line with tension)  
**Feeling:** Anchor in the dark, steady, never repeating the same note.

---

### **Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4 with **7th chords**.  
**Bar 2:**  
On beat 2: **Fm7** (F, Ab, Bb, D♭)  
On beat 4: **A♭7** (A♭, C, D♭, F)  
**Feeling:** Smooth, but with a bite — like a whisper with a knife edge.

---

### **You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif:**  
Bar 2:  
**F - G♭ - A♭ - B♭**  
Play it with a **legato, slow build**, as if you're whispering a secret.  
**End on B♭**, unresolved — like a door left slightly ajar.

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif again, but altered slightly.**  
**F - G♭ - A♭ - B♭**, but now with **a slight bend** on the G♭ and a **half-step delay** on the A♭.  
**End on B♭ again**, but now with a **small vibrato**, like a question being asked twice.

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
Now, **do not resolve**.  
Instead, **play the same motif again**, but **only the first two notes**:  
**F - G♭**, then **rest**.  
Hold that silence.  
Leave the room hanging.  
**Feeling:** Mystery. The answer is just out of reach — and that’s the point.

---

### **Final Feel:**
- **Little Ray** keeps the rhythm tight, like a ticking clock.
- **Marcus** never lets the tension fall.
- **Diane** underlines the mood with discreet, biting chords.
- **You** — the question, the ghost, the memory in the air.

Wayne Shorter leans forward.

That’s the intro.
