### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*(Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth)*

- **1:** Kick on 1, hihat on 1 & 2 & 3 & 4  
- **2:** Kick on 3, hihat on 1 & 2 & 3 & 4  
- **3:** Kick on 1, hihat on 1 & 2 & 3 & 4  
- **4:** Kick on 3, hihat on 1 & 2 & 3 & 4  

**Focus:** A tight, pulsing rhythm. No cymbal crashes. Just the hihat and kick. The heart of the room. The silence between the hits is the breath.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*(Walking line, chromatic approaches, no repeated notes)*

- **Measures:**  
  - 1: D – Eb – C – B  
  - 2: A – G – F – E  
  - 3: D – Eb – C – B  
  - 4: A – G – F – E  

**Focus:** Chromatic tension. Marcus is the anchor, but he’s walking a line that’s not quite in the key. It’s a little off, like a memory slipping through your fingers.

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*(7th chords, comp on 2 and 4, with space in between)*

- **Beat 2:** Dm7 (D F A C)  
- **Beat 4:** G7 (G B D F)  

**Focus:** Diane plays the chords on 2 and 4, with a suspended, angular sound. Her voicings are dark and angular, like she's holding something back. She doesn’t play on 1 or 3 — that’s the space for you to breathe.

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*(Same as Bar 2, but slightly altered)*

- **Measures:**  
  - 1: D – Eb – C – B  
  - 2: A – G – F – E  
  - 3: D – Eb – C – B  
  - 4: A – G – F – E (same as before, but with a slight lower inflection on the F)

**Focus:** Marcus is still walking, but the last note of the bar is a little lower — like a question being held in the air.

---

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
*(Same as Bar 2)*

- **Beat 2:** Dm7  
- **Beat 4:** G7  

**Focus:** Same chords, same timing. She’s not changing, but she’s *listening* — waiting for you to speak.

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*(One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it.)*

**Phrase:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (high F, open, breathy)  
- **Beat 2:** Eb (sliding in, like a whisper)  
- **Beat 3:** D (sustained, like a sigh)  
- **Beat 4:** Rest (silence)  

**Then...**  
- **Beat 1 (next bar):** Bb (out of key, but it fits)  
- **Beat 2:** A  
- **Beat 3:** G  
- **Beat 4:** Rest again  

**Focus:** You don’t play the whole phrase in the 4 bars. You take the first four notes of a melody, leave it unfinished, and let the silence speak. It’s a question, not an answer.

---

### **Final Note (Silence):**  
The room holds. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The silence is heavy. The next note will be the beginning of something.

---

**That’s the intro.**  
You didn’t play a scale. You didn’t shout. You opened a door.  
And now, the music can begin.
