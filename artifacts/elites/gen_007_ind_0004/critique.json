  "rationale": "The arrangement uses basic triads in the piano (C, D, G) with no 7th chords or jazz extensions, resulting in a lack of harmonic sophistication. The rhythm section has some syncopation in the hihat but lacks the complexity of authentic Latin jazz. The saxophone has melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The trumpet is silent throughout, and there's minimal interaction between the horns. The overall feel is academic rather than spontaneous, with little sense of jazz authenticity.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes to the saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in the hihat pattern for a more authentic jazz feel",
    "Use walking bass (roots, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) instead of just root notes",
    "Add ii-V-I progressions in bars 3-4 for authentic jazz harmony"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
