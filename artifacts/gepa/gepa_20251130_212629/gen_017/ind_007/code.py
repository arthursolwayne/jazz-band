**Title: "Hush Before the Storm"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Length: 4 bars (6 seconds)**  

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Time: 0.0 - 1.5 seconds**  
**Rhythm:**  
- Kick: On beat 1 and 3 (strong, resonant)  
- Snare: On beat 2 and 4 (crisp, sharp)  
- Hi-hat: On every eighth note (closed, but with a slight decay on beat 4)  
- **Fill on beat 4:** A quick, sharp rimshot, followed by a soft ghost note on the snare.  

**Dynamic:** Starts soft, builds slightly toward the end of the bar. The energy is tight, controlled — like the edge of a knife.

### **Bar 2: Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line**  
**Time: 1.5 - 3.0 seconds**  
**Notes (F Major scale with chromatic approaches):**  
- **Beat 1:** F  
- **Beat 2:** G (chromatic approach from Gb)  
- **Beat 3:** A  
- **Beat 4:** Bb (chromatic approach from B)  
- **Beat 1 (next bar):** C (chromatic approach from C#)  

**Dynamics:** Starts low and steady, then leans into the Bb with a slight push, as if to say, *“Wait — here it is.”*

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano) – Comping**  
**Time: 1.5 - 3.0 seconds**  
**Chords (F7):**  
- **Beat 2:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
- **Beat 4:** F7 again, but with a slight tension — a Bb in the left hand, a diminished 7th in the right.  
- **Voicing:** Diane plays the F7 in 3rds, but adds a Bb in the left hand on beat 4, creating a subtle clash that hints at something unresolved.  

**Dynamics:** Quiet, precise, with a lingering resonance — like a ghost of a memory.  

---

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax) – Melody (First half)**  
**Time: 3.0 - 4.5 seconds**  
**Phrase:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (low, smooth, with a breathy start)  
- **Beat 2:** Ab (sliding in slightly, with a gentle vibrato)  
- **Beat 3:** Bb (a pause before the note, like a question)  
- **Beat 4:** Rest  

**Dynamics:** Starts with a soft, smoky tone, builds slightly on the Ab, then holds the Bb with a slight hesitation — the note is there, but it’s not resolved.

### **Bar 4: Everyone In – Completion and Hesitation**  
**Time: 4.5 - 6.0 seconds**  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (a return, but lower, with more weight)  
- **Beat 2:** C (a leap, a surprise)  
- **Beat 3:** Bb (again, but this time softer, like a sigh)  
- **Beat 4:** Rest  

**Marcus:**  
- **Beat 1:** C (chromatic approach from C#)  
- **Beat 2:** D (open, ringing)  
- **Beat 3:** Eb (tense, unresolved)  
- **Beat 4:** F (back to the root, but with a slight drag)  

**Diane:**  
- **Beat 2:** F7 again, but with a Bb in the left hand, a diminished 7th in the right — tension, not resolution.  
- **Beat 4:** F7 again, but with a slight delay in the right hand, like a hesitation.  

**Little Ray:**  
- **Beat 1:** Kick on 1  
- **Beat 2:** Snare, with a ghost note on the hi-hat  
- **Beat 3:** Kick on 3  
- **Beat 4:** Snare, a soft rimshot, and a final ghost on the hi-hat  

**Final Moment:**  
The last note is a rest. The ensemble holds the silence for a full beat. No resolution, no closure. Just the *hush before the storm*.

### **Final Notes:**  
This intro is not about showing off. It's about *fragments of thought*, *tension held in the air*, and a question that lingers in the dark. Wayne Shorter’s eyes narrow slightly. He leans in. He’s heard the question. Now he’s waiting for the answer.  

You’ve made him wait. Now, it’s time to answer.
