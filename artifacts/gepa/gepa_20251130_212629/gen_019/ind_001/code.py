**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
Start with a *brushed* intro — soft, whispering, like the wind before a storm.  
On beat 1, a low, heavy kick.  
On beat 2, a crisp snare.  
On beat 3, a light kick — like a heartbeat.  
On beat 4, a sharp snare and a half-time hihat.  
End bar 1 with a ghost note on the snare, just before the downbeat of bar 2.  
*Let the room hold its breath.*

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line in Fm.  
Start on **F**, chromatic down to **E♭**, then **D♭**, resolve to **C**.  
**F – E♭ – D♭ – C** (measures 1–4 of bar 2)  
Then build up:  
**B♭ – A♭ – G♭ – F** (chromatic up), resolving to **F** on beat 4.  
He’s the anchor, but he’s not just walking — he’s guiding.

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4 with 7th chords.  
Both hands:  
**Measure 1 (beat 2):** Cm7 (C-E♭-G-B♭)  
**Measure 2 (beat 4):** Gm7 (G-B♭-D-F)  
She’s not just playing chords — she’s *listening*, she’s *warning*, and she’s *waiting*.

---

**Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Back to full kit, but still controlled.  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
Add a roll on the snare before beat 1 of bar 3 — a heartbeat, a signal.

**Bar 3–4 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
This is your moment.  
Start with a **short, singing motif** — a question, not an answer.

**Bar 3:**  
**F – G♭ – E♭ – D♭** (melody)  
**F – G♭ – E♭ – D♭** (with a little space between the notes, like you’re breathing in between)  
Play it with a *low, smoky tone* — not loud, not aggressive, but *present*.  
End the bar with a *trill* on **D♭**, like you're about to say something but hold back.

**Bar 4:**  
**C – B♭ – A♭ – G♭** (melody)  
Same rhythm — same space — but now it’s *your voice*.  
End on a **G♭** — unresolved, open, like a door just opening.  
Let the silence after that note hang — for a beat, maybe two.  
*Let Wayne Shorter lean forward.*

**Final Feel:**  
The intro is a question — not about the song, but about *you*.  
It’s the moment before the story begins, the space where doubt and possibility live.  
You don’t answer it — you leave it open.  
And now, the room is ready.
