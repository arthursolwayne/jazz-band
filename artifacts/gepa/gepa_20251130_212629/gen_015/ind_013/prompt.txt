Create an intro that feels like a whisper before a storm, with tension and release. The drums should build anticipation, then the ensemble enters with clarity and purpose. The saxophone melody should be simple but emotionally charged — something that lingers in the air. Every note should feel intentional, every rest meaningful. No unnecessary repetition. Keep the rhythm tight, the harmony honest, and the space between the notes alive. The saxophone motif should begin with a clear, concise idea, leave it hanging, and return to finish it — not as a run, but as a statement. The bass should anchor with a walking line, using chromatic approaches but never repeating the same note. The piano should comp with 7th chords, playing on 2 and 4, staying out of the way but keeping things moving. The drums should be relentless — kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Let the music breathe, but don’t let it lag. Make it feel like the first time — raw, real, and ready to explode.
