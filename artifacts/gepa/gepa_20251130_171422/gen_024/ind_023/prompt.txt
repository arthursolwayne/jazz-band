You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:  
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.  
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.  
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.  
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

**TIMING**: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

**ARRANGEMENT**:
- **Bar 1**: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait.  
- **Bars 2-4**: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before.

**COMPOSITION GUIDANCE**:
- **Marcus**: Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He’s the anchor.  
- **Diane**: 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving.  
- **Little Ray**: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar.  
- **You**: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit.

**MUSICAL GUIDANCE**:
- The first bar should feel like a question — something unresolved, something waiting to be answered. Use space, tension, and rhythm to create intrigue.
- The next three bars should feel like the search for an answer. Use dynamic variation, rhythmic contrast, and avoid predictable patterns.
- The melody should be sparse but expressive, the rhythm should be urgent but not frantic, and the space between notes should say as much as the notes themselves.
- Make sure the music feels like it's pulling the listener in — emotionally charged, with a sense of direction and purpose.
- Use rests and silence to create tension. Avoid overplaying.
- The key is singular. No modulation. You’ve got 6 seconds.
