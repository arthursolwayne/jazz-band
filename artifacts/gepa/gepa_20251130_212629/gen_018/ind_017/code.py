**Bar 1 (0:00–1:50):**  
**Little Ray on Drums**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Play with subtle tension — a triplet feel on the hihat, but don’t land the snare on the downbeat. Let the silence between the hits feel like anticipation. The bar doesn’t close — it *waits*.  

**Bar 2 (1:50–3:40):**  
**Marcus on Bass**  
Start with a chromatic descent from B♭ to F, resolving on the downbeat of 2. Then walk a line in Fm:  
**B♭ – A – G – F**  
Keep the rhythm off the grid — syncopated, but never predictable. Let it breathe between the notes.  

**Diane on Piano**  
Comp on beats 2 and 4 with a B♭7 chord, but play it with a dissonant voicing:  
**B♭ – E♭ – G – D♭**  
Hold the D♭ just long enough to make it ache.  

**Bar 3 (3:40–5:30):**  
**You on Tenor Sax**  
Play this motif:  
**F – B♭ – A – (rest)**  
Start with a soft, breathy F, then slide up to B♭ with a slight growl. Land on A with a little tongue stop, then go silent. Let the rest hang — don’t fill it. This is the question.  

**Bar 4 (5:30–6:00):**  
**Marcus**  
Continue the walking line:  
**E♭ – D – C – B♭**  
**Diane**  
Comp again on beat 4, this time with a C7 chord:  
**C – E – B♭ – D**  
But play it as if it’s a mistake, a hesitation.  
**Little Ray**  
Same rhythm as before, but now the hihat has a slight rub against the snare — a tension that never resolves.  
**You**  
Answer the question with a single note:  
**F**, held just long enough to mean something.  
Then, silence.  

The room holds its breath.  
Wayne Shorter nods.  
He’s heard it.
