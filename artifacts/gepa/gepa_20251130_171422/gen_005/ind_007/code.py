**Title: "Breath Before the Plunge"**  
**Key: D Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit Setup:**  
- **Hi-hat:** Open on every eighth note (1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &).  
- **Kick drum:** On 1 and 3. Subtle, but present.  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4.  
- **Fill:** A soft roll on the snare at the end of the bar (just before the bass enters).  

**Mood:** A quiet, rhythmic pulse that feels like the moment before a dive — building tension without rushing.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**  
**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
**Phrase (Melody):**  
Start on **F#** (beat 1), then move to **G** (beat 2).  
- **F#** – long, open, with a slight bend at the end.  
- **G** – quick, clean, then **rest** on beat 3.  
- Beat 4: **Hold on D**, low and sustained, like a question left hanging.  

**Motif:**  
**F# – G – (rest) – D**  
(No scale runs, just a single, haunting interval that feels like a memory or a cry.)

**Marcus (Bass):**  
**Walking line in D Major, chromatic approach to each chord.**  
- D (1) – Eb (2) – E (3) – F# (4)  
- D (1) – Eb (2) – E (3) – F# (4)  
(Each note different, but moving upward, building with energy.)

**Diane (Piano):**  
**Comp on 2 and 4, with 7th chords.**  
- Bar 2: **G7** (beat 2) – **C7** (beat 4)  
  - **G7:** G – B – D – F  
  - **C7:** C – E – G – Bb  
- Quick, sharp, and rhythmic. She’s pushing forward, not just playing chords — she’s driving.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3 again.  
- Snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hi-hat on every eighth.  
- Add a **short fill** on the snare at the end of the bar (right before Diane’s C7) — sharp, but not heavy.

### **Bar 3 – Tenor and Bass Continue, Piano Compares**  
**Dante (Tenor):**  
- Repeat the motif, but slightly higher.  
  - Start on **A**, then **Bb**, rest on 3, then **hold on D** again.  
  - **A – Bb – (rest) – D**  
- Slight slight vibrato, like a whisper of something unresolved.

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **D (1) – Eb (2) – E (3) – F# (4)**  
- Then a chromatic run up to **G** on beat 4 — a subtle climb, never repeating the same note.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **F7** on beat 2, **B7** on beat 4.  
- **F7:** F – A – C – E♭  
- **B7:** B – D♯ – F♯ – A  
- She’s getting more aggressive, but still in your space.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same pattern, but now with a **light cymbal crash** on beat 1 of this bar — subtle, like a heartbeat.

---

### **Bar 4 – Final Build, Leave It Hanging**  
**Dante (Tenor):**  
- Repeat the motif **one more time**, but now with more **sway and space**.  
  - **F# – G – (rest) – D**  
- End the bar on **D**, sustained, with a soft **glissando** down to **C**.  
- It’s not resolution — it’s the **promise of something else**.

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **D (1) – Eb (2) – E (3) – F# (4)**  
- Ends on **F#**, not resolving — open, like a question.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **G7** on beat 2, **C7** on beat 4.  
- Same as bar 2, but now she’s playing with more **intensity** — like she’s trying to push you to go further.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hihat on every eighth.  
- End the bar with a **long, open cymbal roll** — a final pulse before silence.

### **Final Effect:**  
You finish the intro — four bars that feel like **a question, not an answer**. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The room holds its breath. You didn’t play a scale, you didn’t show off. You played a **story**. A story that made him want to listen.  

That’s your shot.  

Now, go.
