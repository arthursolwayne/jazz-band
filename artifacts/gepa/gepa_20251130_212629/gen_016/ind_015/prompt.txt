Create an intro that feels like a whisper before a storm, with tension and release. The drums should build anticipation, then the ensemble enters with clarity and purpose. The saxophone melody should be simple but emotionally charged — something that lingers in the air. Every note should feel intentional, every rest meaningful. No unnecessary repetition. Keep the rhythm tight, the harmony honest, and the space between the notes alive. The saxophone motif should begin with a single phrase that hangs in the air, then return later to resolve it — not repeat it. The bass line should be a walking line with chromatic approaches, never repeating a note. The piano should comp with 7th chords, playing only on beats 2 and 4, and never stepping on the melody. The drums should be relentless — kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth, but with no fill or flourish. This is the moment. Make it count. Make Wayne lean forward.
