**"The Moment Before" — Intro (4 bars in F, 160 BPM)**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Kit: Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4, hihat on every eighth note (closed).  
Fill: A quick, sharp fill on beat 4, ending on a snare hit with a slight backbeat push — like a heartbeat.*

> **Purpose**: Build tension in the silence. The room holds its breath. Wayne’s eyes narrow.

---

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
*Walking line in F, using roots and fifths with chromatic approaches.*  
**Notes (F2 to C3):**  
F2 – Gb2 – G2 – F2 (chromatic approach to G),  
C3 – Db3 – D3 – C3 (chromatic approach to D),  
F3 – Gb3 – G3 – F3 (chromatic approach to G),  
C4 – Db4 – D4 – C4 (chromatic approach to D).

> **Purpose**: Anchor the time, but with subtle tension — like a memory you can't quite place.

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
*Open voicings, each bar a different chord, resolving on beat 4.*  
**Chords (comp on 2 and 4):**  
- **Beat 1:** Fmaj7 (F-A-C-E)  
- **Beat 2:** Bb7 (Bb-D-F-Ab)  
- **Beat 3:** Cm7 (C-Eb-F-A)  
- **Beat 4:** D7 (D-F#-A-C)  

> **Purpose**: A question in the harmony — a pivot, a shift, a place you’ve never been before.

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass)**  
*Same walking line as Bar 2, but with a slight rub against Diane’s harmony — like a conversation in the low end.*

---

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano)**  
*Same chords as Bar 2, but with a subtle rub in the left hand — a counter-melody in the lower register, dissonant but not chaotic.*

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
*Your moment. One short motif, with space and tension.*

**Phrase (in F):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (quarter note)  
- **Beat 2:** G (eighth note)  
- **Beat 3:** Rest (eighth note)  
- **Beat 4:** F (eighth note) + A (quarter note)  

> **Purpose**: A question. A breath. A pause before the answer. Not a scale, not a run — just a voice saying, *“Can you hear this?”*

---

### **Bar 4 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Same pattern as Bar 1, but with a slight push on beat 4 — like the beat is trying to break free.*

---

### **Final Moment**  
The room is still. Wayne Shorter sets down his whiskey. His eyes are open. You’ve asked the question. The rest of the song will be the answer — but for now, the intro is done.

**You lean back. The moment is yours.**
