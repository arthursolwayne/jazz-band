**Title: "First Light"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Time: 4 bars = 6.0 seconds**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
A single, slow kick on beat 1, followed by a snare on beat 3.  
Hihat on every eighth, but with a slight hesitation on the "and" of 2 and 4 to create tension.  
No cymbal crash, just the ticking of a clock before midnight.  
*Let them wait. Let the silence build.*

---

**Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters:**

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  F2 (F), G2 (G), Ab2 (Ab), A2 (A) – walking line with chromatic approaches.  
  F – G – Ab – A – G – F (chromatic approach on G to A).  
  Root on beat 1, fifth on beat 3, chromatic on beat 4, resolving back to F on the "and" of 4.

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  Open voicing: Fmaj7 (F, A, C, E) – but with a Bb in the right hand to create a subtle tension.  
  Chord on beat 2 (comp).  
  Next bar: G7 (G, B, D, F) – but with an F# in the right hand for color.  
  Chord on beat 4 (comp).  
  Tension, but not chaos. She's angry, but she knows the rules.

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  Kick on 1 and 3.  
  Snare on 2 and 4.  
  Hihat on every eighth.  
  Slight fill on beat 3 with a ghost note on the snare, leading into the melody.

- **You (Tenor Sax):**  
  A short, searching motif:  
  **Notes (in F):**  
  F – G – Ab – (rest)  
  Wait. Let it hang.  
  Let the audience, let Wayne, feel the question before the answer.

**Bar 3 – Full Ensemble:**

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  C2 (C), D2 (D), Eb2 (Eb), E2 (E) – walking line with chromatic approaches.

  Root on beat 1, fifth on beat 3, chromatic on beat 4, resolving back to C on the "and" of 4.

  Chord on beat 2 (comp).  
  Next bar: D7 (D, F#, A, C) – with a C# in the right hand.  
  Chord on beat 4 (comp).  
  She’s not just playing chords — she’s questioning the form.

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  Kick on 1 and 3.  
  Snare on 2 and 4.  
  Hihat on every eighth.  
  Fill on beat 3 with a ghost note and half-time snare.

- **You (Tenor Sax):**  
  Repeat the motif, but with slight variation:  
  F – G – Ab – (rest)  
  Then, a sudden, sharp **G** on beat 3 – a step forward.  
  *Like a door opening.*

**Bar 4 – Full Ensemble:**

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  Bb2 (Bb), B2 (B), C2 (C), C#2 (C#) – walking line with chromatic approaches.

  Root on beat 1, fifth on beat 3, chromatic on beat 4, resolving back to Bb on the "and" of 4.

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  Open voicing: Bbmaj7 (Bb, D, F, Ab) – with a D# in the right hand.  
  Chord on beat 2 (comp).  
  Next bar: C7 (C, E, G, Bb) – with a B in the right hand.  
  Chord on beat 4 (comp).  
  She’s resolving, but not fully. The tension is still there.

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  Kick on 1 and 3.  
  Snare on 2 and 4.  
  Hihat on every eighth.  
  Fill on beat 3 with a quick roll, leading into your final phrase.

- **You (Tenor Sax):**  
  Return to the motif, but now **complete it**:  
  F – G – Ab – **F**  
  A simple, singing resolution.  
  No flourish. No show.  
  Just the answer to the question that was asked in the first bar.  
  *The discovery.*

**Final Note:**  
The intro ends with that final **F** on your saxophone — a clean, clear, open sound.  
Silence. No applause.  
Wayne Shorter raises his glass.  
He’s heard something he didn’t expect.  
Something that feels like the start of a journey.
