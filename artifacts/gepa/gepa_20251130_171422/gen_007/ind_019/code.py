**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Quiet, but not empty.*  
- Kick on beat 1  
- Snare on beat 3  
- Hihat on every eighth (but soft, almost ghosted)  
- A subtle ride cymbal on beat 2 and 4, just a whisper  
- The room holds its breath. The tension begins.

*Marcus (Bass):*  
- D → C# → B → A (chromatic descent, walking line)

- Keep it moving, no repetition, every note breathes

*Diane (Piano):*  
- D7 (D-F#-A-C#) on beat 2  
- A7 (A-C#-E-G) on beat 4  
- Comping on 2 and 4, sparse but precise, 7th chords only  
- Let the space be felt, not filled

*Dante (Tenor Sax):*  
- **Motif 1: D – F# – B – (rest)**  
  - Play the first three notes with a slight hesitation  
  - Let the last note hang in the air  
  - A whisper with teeth, like a question

**Bar 3 – Momentum builds:**  
*Marcus (Bass):*  
- C → B → A → G (chromatic descent)

- Still walking, still moving, still playing forward

*Diane (Piano):*  
- G7 (G-B-D-F#) on beat 2  
- C7 (C-E-G-B) on beat 4  
- The harmony shifts, the tension rises

*Dante (Tenor Sax):*  
- **Motif 2: A – C# – F# – (rest)**  
  - Echo the first motif, but a half-step higher  
  - Same structure, same hesitation  
  - The melody grows, but never resolves

**Bar 4 – Release and mark:**  
*Marcus (Bass):*  
- G → F# → E → D (chromatic ascent)

*Diane (Piano):*  
- D7 (D-F#-A-C#) on beat 2  
- D7 (D-F#-A-C#) on beat 4  
- The harmony returns home, but with a bite

*Dante (Tenor Sax):*  
- **Motif 3: D – F# – B – D**  
  - Now complete, now resolved  
  - The whisper becomes a statement  
  - The room breaks  
  - Wayne Shorter leans forward

*The room breathes. The night begins.*
