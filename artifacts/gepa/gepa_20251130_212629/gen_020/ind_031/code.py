**Title: "Whispers of the River"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Form: 4-bar jazz piece**  
**Style: Mid-tempo, lyrical, atmospheric jazz with space and texture**

---

### **Bar 1: Saxophone (Tenor or Alto)**
*(A question, soft and searching, with space in between notes)*

**Melody (F jazz minor scale with resolution):**  
F – G – Ab – Bb – Bb – C – Bb – Ab  
*Let the first note linger, then let the others follow with intention. The line should feel like a breath, not a statement. The Ab and Bb create tension and mystery.*

---

### **Bar 2: Piano (Left Hand: Bass Line / Right Hand: Chords)**
*(Chords as color, not noise. Each chord is a moment of atmosphere.)*

**Left Hand (Bass Line – F minor blues feel):**  
F – Bb – Ab – G – F  
*Move like a river — fluid, unpredictable, but rooted in F.*

**Right Hand (Chords – slow, spacious):**  
F7 (F A C Eb) – Bb7 (Bb D F Ab) – Ab7 (Ab C Eb Gb) – G7 (G B D F)  
*Let each chord ring with resonance. No rush. Let the sound breathe.*

---

### **Bar 3: Bass (Double Bass or Electric)**
*(Like a river — always moving, never repeating the same path.)*

**Melodic Line (walking bass with soul):**  
F – Bb – Ab – G – F – Bb – Ab – G  
*Let the notes be a whisper, not a shout. Each note should feel like a ripple in the water, not a splash.*

---

### **Bar 4: Drums (Brushes or Light Sticks)**
*(Every hit is an emotion. No noise just for rhythm — every sound has a story.)*

**Rhythmic Focus:**  
- **Snare:** On 2 & 4, but not loud — soft, with a pulse.
- **Hi-hat:** Gentle, open, with a few syncopated accents.
- **Bass Drum:** Subtle, on the downbeats, like a heartbeat.
- **Cymbal:** One soft crash on the last beat — a pause, a sigh, a resolution.

---

### **Final Moment: Silence**
*(Let it end not with a note, but with space.)*  
A final sustained chord from the piano (F7), and a soft release.  
The saxophone fades, the bass slows, the drums fall silent.  
Silence becomes a player — not empty, but full of possibility.

**Note for Performance:**  
This piece is not about speed or technical display. It’s about the space between the notes, the breath of the players, and the story that emerges when instruments listen to each other.

Let it be slow, let it be spaced, let it be felt.
