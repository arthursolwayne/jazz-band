**Mood: Suspense, intimacy, a question in the dark**

---

### **Bar 1 (0.0–1.5 sec): Little Ray – Drums**  
*Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Starts soft, almost like a heartbeat.*

- **Kick**: D2 (MIDI 38), F#2 (MIDI 41), D2 (MIDI 38)  
- **Snare**: G2 (MIDI 43), Bb2 (MIDI 42)  
- **Hi-hat**: Half-open, sharp but not loud, on every eighth, with a slight swell at the end of the bar.

---

### **Bar 2 (1.5–3.0 sec): Marcus – Bass (Walking Line)**  
*Roots and fifths, with chromatic approach on the 3rd beat of the bar.*

- **Beat 1**: D2 (MIDI 38)  
- **Beat 2**: F#2 (MIDI 41)  
- **Beat 3**: E2 (MIDI 40) → D2 (MIDI 38)

---

### **Bar 2 (1.5–3.0 sec): Diane – Piano (Open Voicings)**  
*Comp on 2 and 4. Rootless, modern voicings, slightly dissonant but grounded in D minor.*

- **Beat 1**: Rest  
- **Beat 2**: Cm7 (C-Eb-G-Bb)  
- **Beat 3**: Rest  
- **Beat 4**: Dm7 (D-F-A-C) — resolving the tension

---

### **Bar 3 (3.0–4.5 sec): You – Tenor Sax (Motif – Start)**  
*One short, fragmented motif. It’s a question, not an answer. Use space between the notes.*

- **Beat 1**: F (MIDI 71) — long, smooth, high in the register  
- **Beat 2**: Rest  
- **Beat 3**: D (MIDI 62) — low, breathy, almost a whisper  
- **Beat 4**: Rest

---

### **Bar 4 (4.5–6.0 sec): Full Ensemble – Motif – Resolution**  
*You return to finish the motif, with full support. It’s not a resolution, but a continuation — a promise.*

- **You – Tenor Sax**:  
  - **Beat 1**: E (MIDI 69) — slightly bent, a half-step above D  
  - **Beat 2**: Rest  
  - **Beat 3**: D (MIDI 62) — same note as before, now with more weight  
  - **Beat 4**: Rest

- **Marcus – Bass**:  
  - **Beat 1**: D2 (MIDI 38)  
  - **Beat 2**: F#2 (MIDI 41)  
  - **Beat 3**: E2 (MIDI 40) → D2 (MIDI 38)  
  - **Beat 4**: A2 (MIDI 45)

- **Diane – Piano**:  
  - **Beat 1**: Rest  
  - **Beat 2**: Cm7 (C-Eb-G-Bb)  
  - **Beat 3**: Rest  
  - **Beat 4**: Dm7 (D-F-A-C)

- **Little Ray – Drums**:  
  - **Beat 1**: Kick on 1, hi-hat on every eighth  
  - **Beat 2**: Snare on 2, hi-hat on every eighth  
  - **Beat 3**: Kick on 3, hi-hat on every eighth  
  - **Beat 4**: Snare on 4, hi-hat on every eighth — slightly louder, as if the room is holding its breath

**Final Note**:  
The last note on the sax hangs in the air — a question. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The room is still. And the music begins.
