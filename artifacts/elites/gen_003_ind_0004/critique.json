  "rationale": "This arrangement lacks essential jazz harmony elements, using only triads (C, D, G, Am, F) without 7th extensions or ii-V-I progressions. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat hitting only a few upbeats inconsistently. The saxophone melody has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The trumpet is silent throughout, and there's no call-and-response or interplay between instruments. The overall feel is mechanical and lacks the soul and sophistication of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes to saxophone lines for bebop flavor and melodic sophistication",
    "Introduce more upbeat syncopation in the hihat pattern to create a Latin jazz groove",
    "Use walking bass lines (roots, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) instead of just root notes",
    "Add a trumpet line with melodic content to create call-and-response with the saxophone"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
