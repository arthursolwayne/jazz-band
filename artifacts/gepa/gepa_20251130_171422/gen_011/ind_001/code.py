**Title: "Whispers in the Cellar"**  
**Key: D minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  
**Mood: Restless, searching, yearning — a whisper that wants to scream.**

### **Bar 1: Little Ray – Drums (Open Space)**  
- **Kick:** On beat 1 only (low, deep, like a heartbeat).  
- **Snare:** On beat 3 (light, dry, like a breath).  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (closed, tight, but not too loud).  
- **Fill:** Nothing. Just the space. Let the room breathe.  
- **Dynamics:** *Pianissimo*, but present. The silence is part of the story.

- **Notes (in D minor):**  
  - B♭ (beat 1)  
  - D (beat 2)  
  - F (beat 3)  
  - A♭ (beat 4)  
- **Left hand:** Chromatic approach on beat 2 (C♭) to D.  
- **Right hand:** Light slap on beat 1 and 3, fingerstyle on 2 and 4.

### **Bar 2: Diane – Piano (Comping)**  
- **Chords on 2 & 4:**  
  - Beat 2: Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
  - Beat 4: G7♭9 (G, B, D, F, A♭)  
- **Voicings:** Rootless, sparse, with a touch of dissonance.  
- **Right hand:** Quick, staccato notes (C, E♭, G) on beat 2, resolving into the G7.  
- **Left hand:** Walking bass line underneath, but not too loud.  
- **Dynamics:** *Piano*, just enough to support, not to compete.

### **Bar 3: You – Tenor Sax (Motif – First Half)**  
- **Phrase (measured, slow, with space):**  
  - D (beat 1) – F (beat 2) – B♭ (beat 3) – rest (beat 4)  
- **Phrasing:** Legato, with a slight *crescendo* on the F.  
- **Dynamics:** *Mezzo-forte* on D, *forte* on F, *piano* on B♭, *pianissimo* on the rest.  
- **Feel:** Like a question. Like a memory not yet remembered.

- **You – Tenor Sax (continuation):**  
  - E♭ (beat 1) – D (beat 2) – F (beat 3) – rest (beat 4)  
  - *Same dynamics as Bar 3, but with a slight *decrescendo* on the D.*  
- **Marcus – Bass:**  
  - C (beat 1) – E♭ (beat 2) – G (beat 3) – B♭ (beat 4)  
  - Chromatic approach on beat 1 (B) to C.  
- **Diane – Piano:**  
  - Cm7 (beat 1) – F7 (beat 2) – Bm7♭5 (beat 3) – E7 (beat 4)  
  - Right hand: Arpeggios with a bluesy edge.  
- **Little Ray – Drums:**  
  - Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
  - Slight fill on beat 3: Hi-hat splash, then snare snap.  
- **Dynamics:** *Crescendo* through the bar, ending on *pianissimo* — unfinished, like a breath held.

**Final Note:**  
At the end of bar 4, the room holds.  
No applause.  
No laughter.  
Just the sound of a man in the back of the room leaning forward.  
Wayne Shorter.  
He’s heard it.  
He’s listening.
