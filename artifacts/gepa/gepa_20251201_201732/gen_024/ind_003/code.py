**Title: "Whispers in the Cellar"**  
**Key: Dm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 6.0 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Drum pattern:*
- Kick on beats 1 and 3 (snare on 2 and 4)
- Hi-hat on every eighth note
- No fill, just tension.  
*Feel: A slow build, like a breath being held.*

---

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano) – Comping**  
*Chord: Cm7 (Dm key center, subdominant)*  
- Open voicing: C-E♭-G-B♭  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4 (no 1 or 3)  
- Chord hangs, unresolved, like a question.

---

### **Bar 3: Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line (D2-G2 range)**  
*Line:*
- D2 (root) → F2 (minor 3rd) → G2 (fifth) → E♭2 (chromatic approach to D)  
*Pattern: Root, 3rd, 5th, chromatic approach to root*  
*Feel: Anchored, but with a subtle tension that leads forward.*

---

### **Bar 4: Diane (Piano) – Comping**  
*Chord: G7 (V of Cm, leading to Dm)*  
- Open voicing: G-B-D-F  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4  
- Chord resolves, but not to Dm — it’s just a *hint* of where it might go.

### **Bar 4: Dante (Tenor Sax) – Melody**  
*Melody (written in Dm):*  
- Bar 4, beat 1: **D (Dm root)**  
- Bar 4, beat 2: **F (minor 3rd)**  
- Bar 4, beat 3: **G (fifth)**  
- Bar 4, beat 4: **C (chromatic approach to D)**  
*Starts on the first beat, ends on the fourth with a suspended note — like a question in the air.*

*Technique:*  
- Play the motif with a warm, open tone.  
- Let the note on beat 4 hang — don’t resolve it.  
- It’s not a question with an answer — it’s a question that *waits*.

### **Total Feel:**

- The first bar is silence, tension, a heartbeat not yet heard.
- The second bar introduces a shadow of sound — a Cm7 that lingers.
- The third bar grounds it, but with a chromatic touch that makes you wonder.
- The fourth bar *sings* — a single, simple line that carries the weight of everything in the room.
