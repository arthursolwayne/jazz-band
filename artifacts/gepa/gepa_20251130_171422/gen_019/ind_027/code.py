---

### **Bar 1 (Drums Only – Little Ray)**  
**Kit Setup:**  
- **Kick:** On beat 1 and 3, soft, focused.  
- **Snare:** On beat 2 and 4, sharp but not loud.  
- **Hi-Hat:** On every eighth note, ghosted on 2 and 4, open on 1 and 3.  
- **Fill:** A two-note cymbal crash on beat 4, just before the band comes in.  

**Feel:** Tense, expectant. The room holds its breath. You can feel the weight of the room — and the man in the back.

### **Bars 2–4 (Full Quartet)**

#### **Bar 2 (Marcus – Bass)**  
**Line:**  
D → Eb → F → G (walking up, chromatic approach on the G).  
- D (1) – Eb (2) – F (3) – G (4)  
- **Chromatic Target:** Resolves to G on beat 4, hanging on the edge of a chord.

#### **Bar 2 (Diane – Piano)**  
**Comp:**  
- **Beat 2:** D7 (D, F#, A, C)  
- **Beat 4:** G7 (G, B, D, F)  
- **Voice Leading:** Use descending 7th chords to create motion, avoiding static harmony.  
- **Phrasing:** Let the chords fall behind the melody, not in front. She’s there to support, not to shout.

#### **Bar 2 (You – Tenor Sax)**  
**Melody:**  
- **Beat 1:** D (sustained, low and dark)  
- **Beat 2:** Eb (sliding in, like a question)  
- **Beat 3:** F (rising, searching)  
- **Beat 4:** Silence (rest) – let the space speak.

**Technique:** A smooth, slow attack on the D, like you’re drawing it from a memory. The Eb is a whisper, the F is a step forward. Then — silence. Let the room hold it.

---

#### **Bar 3 (Marcus – Bass)**  
**Line:**  
G → A → Bb → B (chromatic approach to B, leading to the next chord)  
- G (1) – A (2) – Bb (3) – B (4)  
- **Feel:** The line is tense, like it's pushing itself forward, trying to get somewhere.

#### **Bar 3 (Diane – Piano)**  
**Comp:**  
- **Beat 2:** B7 (B, D#, F#, A)  
- **Beat 4:** Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
- **Voice Leading:** The B7 leads into the Dm7, creating a sense of release.

#### **Bar 3 (You – Tenor Sax)**  
**Melody:**  
- **Beat 1:** Bb (coming back, like a memory)  
- **Beat 2:** C (a breath, a pause)  
- **Beat 3:** D (rising again, almost to the top)  
- **Beat 4:** Silence (again) – let it breathe

**Technique:** The Bb is a low, dark, questioning note. The C is a breath — not a note, but a space. The D on beat 3 is a footstep — like you're stepping into the dark. Then silence again.

---

#### **Bar 4 (Marcus – Bass)**  
**Line:**  
B → C → D → D (chromatic approach to D, resolving on the last beat)  
- B (1) – C (2) – D (3) – D (4)  
- **Feel:** The line is resolving, but not completely — it’s holding the tension, waiting for the resolution.

#### **Bar 4 (Diane – Piano)**  
**Comp:**  
- **Beat 2:** D7 (D, F#, A, C)  
- **Beat 4:** G7 (G, B, D, F)  
- **Voice Leading:** The last chord is a G7, leading the ear forward — like the song hasn’t ended yet.

#### **Bar 4 (You – Tenor Sax)**  
**Melody:**  
- **Beat 1:** D (a return, a landing)  
- **Beat 2:** Eb (a question, again)  
- **Beat 3:** F (a step forward, like the first time)  
- **Beat 4:** D (a resolution, but not a conclusion) — it’s just the beginning.

**Technique:** The D on beat 1 is a full, open note — like you’re finally home. The Eb and F are the same as bar 2, a loop that feels like a memory. Then back to D — not the same, but close. A moment of truth.

### **Final Note:**
You end on D, not the same D you started with. It’s softer, more certain. Wayne Shorter looks up. He nods. You've said something he hadn’t heard before — and it was worth waiting for.

**6 seconds.**  
**One motif.**  
**A moment.**  
**A whisper in the dark.**
