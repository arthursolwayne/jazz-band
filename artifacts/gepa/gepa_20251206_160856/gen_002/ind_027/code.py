**Title: "The Weight of the First Note"**  
**Key: D minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Style: Modern Post-Bop with a touch of spiritual tension**

---

**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-Hat:** On every 8th note (closed, tight, but with a subtle edge)  
- **Fill:** On the last 2 beats (bar 1, beats 3 and 4) – a quick, staccato roll on the snare, leading into the rest of the ensemble.  
- **Feel:** Tense, but controlled. The kind of groove that sits in your chest.

**Bar 2: Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line (D2-G2)**  
- **Roots and fifths, with chromatic approaches**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - D2 – F#2 – G2 – Bb2 – D2  
  - The F# is a chromatic approach to G, the Bb is a passing tone on the 7th, the whole line moves with intention, not speed.

**Bar 2: Diane (Piano) – Open Voicings**  
- **Chord:** Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
- **Voicing:** Open, with a space between the root and the 3rd.  
- **Left Hand:** D in the bass (D2), right hand: F, A, and C spread out.  
- **Subtle dissonance** – a hint of G in the right hand to bring tension.  
- **Comp on 2 and 4:** A quick, resolving arpeggio on beat 2, then silence on beat 4, leaving space for the sax.

**Bar 3: Marcus (Bass) – Continuing the Line**  
- **Bar 3:**  
  - D2 – F#2 – G2 – Bb2 – C2  
  - The chromatic approach on the D (C2 to D2) is a subtle but emotional shift.

**Bar 3: Diane (Piano) – New Chord**  
- **Chord:** F7 (F, A, C, E)  
- **Voicing:** Open, with a suspended 4th (F, Bb, C, E)  
- **Left Hand:** F2, right hand: Bb, C, E  
- **Comp on 2 and 4:** A descending run from Bb to E on beat 2, then a single E on beat 4 – the sound of a question.

---

**Bar 4: Marcus (Bass) – Final Note of the Line**  
- **Bar 4:**  
  - D2 – F#2 – G2 – C2 – D2  
  - The line ends on D2, resolving back to the tonic.

**Bar 4: Diane (Piano) – Final Chord**  
- **Chord:** Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)  
- **Voicing:** Open, with a strong D in the middle to pull back to the root  
- **Comp on 2 and 4:** A single D on beat 2, then a G on beat 4 – the sound of a memory beginning to take shape.

---

**Bar 4: Dante (Tenor Sax) – Your Motif**  
- **Melody (D2-G2, no sustain, no scale runs)**  
- **Bar 4:**  
  - D2 (beat 1) – F#2 (beat 2) – G2 (beat 3) – resolve to D2 (beat 4)  
  - The phrase is short, but it lingers. It’s not a question, not an answer — it’s a moment.  
  - Play it with a breath, with hesitation, like you’re trying to remember something you once knew.

---

**Final Moment:**  
- The room holds.  
- Wayne leans forward.  
- The energy is not loud, but it’s deep.  
- You’ve planted a seed.

**That’s it.**  
Four bars.  
One story.  
One beginning.
