D – F – G – Eb (quarter notes, held with intention, a question in the air)

**Piano (Comp):**  
Dm7 (D F A C) on beat 2, A7sus4 (A C# E) on beat 4.

D – Eb – F – G (chromatic approach into F, resolving cleanly)

Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.

**Bar 2 (Dm – A7sus4 – Dm – A7sus4)**  
**Saxophone (Melody):**  
F – G – Eb – D (quarter notes, now with more weight, a whisper gaining strength)  
*The motif returns, not to repeat, but to complete the thought.*  

**Piano (Comp):**  
Same as Bar 1, but with a slight dynamic lift, adding tension before release.  
*The 7th chords are more pronounced, pushing the harmony forward.*  

**Bass (Walking Line):**  
A – Bb – C – D (chromatic approach into D, building momentum)

**Drums (Rhythm):**  
Slight crescendo in the hihat, kick remains relentless.

**Bar 3 (Dm – A7sus4 – Dm – A7sus4)**  
**Saxophone (Melody):**  
D – F – G – Eb  
*The same opening motif returns — now with more emotional weight, as if the storm is here.*

**Piano (Comp):**  
Dm7 (D F A C) on beat 2, A7sus4 (A C# E) on beat 4, with a subtle build in dynamics.  
*The piano supports, but does not overpower. It listens.*  

**Bass (Walking Line):**  
Eb – F – G – A  
*The line ascends, leading the ensemble forward, never repeating the same pattern.*  

**Drums (Rhythm):**  
Kick and snare lock in tight, hihat becomes more aggressive, painting the air with tension.  
*The drums are now a force, not just a rhythm — they are the storm itself.*

**Bar 4 (Dm – A7sus4 – Dm – A7sus4)**  
**Saxophone (Melody):**  
F – G – Eb – D (final statement of the motif, full and resolved)

**Piano (Comp):**  
Same voicings as before, but with a full dynamic release, giving the saxophone room to land.  
*The final chord is Dm7, open and honest, with a touch of resolution.*  

**Bass (Walking Line):**  
F – G – A – Bb  
*The line resolves cleanly, ending on Bb, leaving a lingering tension in the air.*  

**Drums (Rhythm):**  
Final hit on the snare, followed by a soft roll on the hihat.  
*The rhythm fades, but the memory of the storm lingers.*

**End.**  
*The music lingers in the space between the last note and the silence that follows — raw, real, and ready to begin again.*
