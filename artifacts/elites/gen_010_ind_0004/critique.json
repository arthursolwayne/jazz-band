  "rationale": "The arrangement lacks jazz harmony with simple triads in the piano (C-E-G, D-F-A, etc.) and no 7th chords or extensions. The rhythm section has some syncopation in the hihat but lacks the authentic Latin jazz feel with more complex rhythmic phrasing. The saxophone line has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The interplay is weak with the trumpet remaining silent throughout and minimal call-and-response between instruments. The overall feel is too academic and lacks the spontaneity and groove of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) minimum",
    "Add chromatic approach notes to saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in hihat pattern instead of straight quarters",
    "Use walking bass (roots, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) instead of just root notes",
    "Add ii-V-I progressions in bars 3-4 for authentic jazz harmony"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
