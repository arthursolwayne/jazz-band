**Intro: "A Question in Fm"**  
*Key: F minor | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4 | Duration: 6.0 seconds*

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Ultra-subtle, almost like a shadow moving in the dark.*  
- Kick: 1 & 3  
- Snare: 2 & 4  
- Hihat: On every eighth  
- *Fill:* A quick, dry brush stroke on the "3" of the bar — like a whisper in the dark.  
- *Rest:* No cymbal crash. No fanfare. Just the sound of the room waiting.

---

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, chromatic, with a twist.*  
- Fm7 → Eb → D → C → Bb  
- *Rhythm:* Quarter notes with a slight syncopation on "2" and "4"  
- *Feel:* Like a man who’s seen the bottom of the world, but still walking.

---

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comping on 2 and 4, 7th chords with a dark edge.*  
- Bar 2:  
  - On "2": A Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb)  
  - On "4": A Bbm7 (Bb, Db, F, Ab)  
- *Voicings:* Rootless, with a dissonant 9th or 11th in the upper register — something that pricks the ear.

---

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Continuing the chromatic line, but now with a release.*  
- C → Bb → A → G  
- *Rhythm:* Same as before, but with a slight pull on the "4" of the bar — like a breath held.

---

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comping again, more aggressive now.*  
- On "2": A Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)  
- On "4": A Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb)  
- *Left hand:* A walking bass line that syncs with Marcus — not the same line, but in conversation.

---

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Your moment. The question.*  
**Motif (Fm):**  
- *Phrase:*  
  - F (1) → Ab (2) → Bb (3) → F (4)  
  - *Rhythm:*  
    - F (1) on beat 1  
    - Ab on & of 1  
    - Bb on beat 2  
    - *Rest* on beat 3  
    - F on beat 4  
- *Feel:* Like a question you’re not sure you want answered.  
- *Dynamics:* Soft, but with a glint of steel.  
- *Phrasing:* The last note (F) is held just a fraction too long — like a breath held in the dark.

---

**Bar 4 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Final punctuation.*  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hihat on every eighth  
- *Fill:* A quick, sharp rimshot on the "3" — like a door closing or a light flickering.

---

**End.**

*The room holds its breath. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The question has been asked. Now, the answer will come.*
