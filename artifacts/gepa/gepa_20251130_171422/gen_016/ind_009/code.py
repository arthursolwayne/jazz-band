- **A question.**  
- **The melody stops mid-air.**  
- **The room holds.**

**Bar 4 (4.50 - 6.00 seconds):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Same walking line, but now with a slight rubato on the final note** (B♭)  
- **Drops to a D on the last eighth**  
- **He’s leaning forward, waiting.**

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Same chords, same rhythm**  
- **But this time, she plays the Dm7 on beat 2 with a slight **delayed attack**  
- **She’s not following — she’s listening.**

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Another kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth**  
- **At 5.625 seconds**, a **brief swell** on the cymbal — like a breath  
- **Then, silence again at 6.00 seconds.**

**End of Intro.**  
**The room is still.**  
**You look up.**  
**Wayne’s eyes are on you.**  
**He’s not smiling.**  
**He’s listening.**  

This is the intro that lingers.  
The kind that asks, *“What happens next?”*  
And waits —  
**for you to answer.**
