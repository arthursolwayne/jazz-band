**Key: D**

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**

**Kick:**  
- On beats 1 and 3 (slightly behind the beat, with a slow build).  
- Use dynamic velocity: soft on 1, louder on 3.  

**Snare:**  
- On 2 and 4.  
- On 2: light, rimshot feel.  
- On 4: punchy, with a slight delay.  

**Hi-hat:**  
- On every eighth note.  
- Start with a light, brushed sound, gradually increasing in intensity.  
- On the last two eighths of the bar, let the hat fall away, leaving silence before the next bar.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters (Diane, Marcus, Dante):**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line in D, with chromatic approaches.  
- Starts on D, walks up to F# (chromatic), then resolves to G.  
- Pattern:  
  - D → F# → G → A  
  - A → B → C → D  
  - D → F# → G → A  
  - A → B → C → D  
- Each note is slightly delayed, giving it a floating, river-like motion.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comping on 2 and 4 with 7th chords.  
- Left hand: Rootless voicings.  
- Right hand: Sharp, emotional, with space between chords.  
- Chords:  
  - On 2: Dmaj7  
  - On 4: G7  
- On the “&” of 2 and 4, Diane plays a dissonant upper extension (e.g., F# or A#) to create tension.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- Simple, haunted motif.  
- Starts on the “&” of 1.  
- Melody:  
  - D → F# → G → A (on the “&” of 1, 2, 3, 4)  
  - Ends on A, suspended — not resolving.  
  - Leave it hanging. Space is everything.

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble (No change in pattern):**

- **Marcus** continues walking line, but subtly shifts the rhythm to 1/8 note triplets on the last two beats.  
- **Diane** plays the same chords, but with a slight rubato on the 4th beat — a moment of emotional release.  
- **Little Ray** intensifies the hihat and adds a rimshot on the “&” of 3.  
- **Dante** plays the same motif again, but this time with a slight vibrato, making the A feel like a question.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble (Final bar):**

- **Marcus** resolves the walking line with a chromatic descent:  
  - D → C → B → A  
- **Diane** plays a final G7 chord, but with a suspended 4th (G7sus4).  
- **Little Ray** plays a fill on the “&” of 3 and 4:  
  - Snare on “&” of 3, kick on 4, hihat on the last two eighths.  
- **Dante** completes the motif:  
  - D → F# → G → A → D  
  - Ends on D, but not with a full note — just a gentle breath, the saxophone fading into the silence of the room.

**Final Moment:**  
Wayne Shorter leans forward, eyes closed.  
He hears something he’s not heard before — not just the notes, but the silence between them.  
The story is told. The door is open.  
Something new has walked through.
