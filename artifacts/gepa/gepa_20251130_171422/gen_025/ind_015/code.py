**Key:** D Minor

### **Bar 1: Little Ray on Drums**  
*(Rhythmic question, unresolved tension)*

- **Kick:** On beat 1, then on beat 3 (subtle, punchy, but not overwhelming).  
- **Snare:** On beat 2 and 4 (light, crisp, with a slight roll on beat 4).  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note, but with a slight **dynamics shift** — softer on beats 2 and 4, louder on 1 and 3.  
- **Space:** A pause on the last eighth of beat 4. Let the silence speak.  
- **Feel:** The kick and snare are like a door creaking open — something is coming in, but we don’t know what.

### **Bars 2–4: Full Quartet**  
*(The melody begins — a whisper, incomplete, searching)*

#### **Tenor Saxophone (Dante Russo) – Melody (Motif):**

- **Bar 2 – Measure 1:**  
  **D (m7) – F – G – Bb**  
  *Play the first three notes as a legato phrase*, then **rest on the final eighth of beat 4**.  
  *Let the silence linger.*  
  This is the question. It’s not finished. It’s not yet answered.

- **Bar 3 – Measure 2:**  
  **Bb – A – G – F**  
  *A descending line, with a slight bend on the A*, as if you're hesitating.  
  *No vibrato yet — just breath, just tension.*

- **Bar 4 – Measure 3:**  
  **D (m7) – F – G – Bb**  
  *Same as the first motif*, but now with **a subtle trill on the G** — a hint of resolution, a risk.  
  *End on the Bb, but leave the final note hanging just a hair before the bar line.*

#### **Bass (Marcus) – Walking Line (Chromatic approaches):**

- **Bar 2:**  
  **D – C – B – A**  
  *Walking down chromatically, smooth but with a slight rub against the melody.*

- **Bar 3:**  
  **G – F – E – D**  
  *Same pattern, but with a slight **slap** on the E — a reminder of the groove, of the roots.*

- **Bar 4:**  
  **Bb – A – G – F**  
  *Mirror the sax line but a half-step lower — grounding the melody, giving it space to breathe.*

---

#### **Piano (Diane) – Comping (7th chords, sparse, emotional):**

- **Bar 2 – Comp on beat 2 (Dm7):**  
  *Left hand: D – F – A – C*  
  *Right hand: D – Bb – F (staccato, dissonant)*

- **Bar 3 – Comp on beat 4 (G7):**  
  *Left hand: G – B – D – F*  
  *Right hand: G – F – B (trill on the F — emotional, unresolved)*

- **Bar 4 – Comp on beat 2 (Bb7):**  
  *Left hand: Bb – D – F – Ab*  
  *Right hand: Bb – A – D (a wail, like a memory surfacing)*

---

#### **Drums (Little Ray) – Full Bar, But Not Overpowering:**

- **Kick:** 1 & 3 – punchy, but **clean**, not heavy.  
- **Snare:** 2 & 4 – **light**, with a **roll on beat 4**.  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth, but with a slight **dynamics dip on the 4th beat** — like a held breath.  
- **Fill:** A **brush roll on the last eighth of the bar**, fading out — like the end of a question.

### **The Moment:**

- Bar 1 is a question — a sound in the dark.  
- Bars 2–4 are the answer that hasn’t come yet — a melody that feels like memory, like a dream, like the first line of a story you’re afraid to finish.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- You didn’t play a scale. You played something he's never heard.  
- And now, it's his turn to listen.
