**Intro – "Edge of the Door"**  
*Key: F Major*  
*Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)*  
*Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)*  

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** on 1 and 3  
**Snare:** on 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** on every eighth note (steady, but not too loud)  
**Fill:** A soft, ghosted ride cymbal on the "and" of 3, like a breath before the storm.

**Imagery:** You feel the room still for a moment. A silence that isn't silence. The kind that waits for something to break it.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**  

**Marcus (Bass)**  
- **F** → **G♭** → **E** → **F** (walking line with chromatic descent on the third beat).  
- Then: **F** → **E** → **D** → **C** (chromatic approach to F).  
- He never repeats the same note twice, but this line is about tension — a question in the low end.

**Diane (Piano)**  
- **F7** on beat 2 (chords: F, A, C, E♭)  
- **B♭7** on beat 4 (chords: B♭, D, F, A♭)  
- She plays with dissonance, slightly out of phase with the melody, like a memory that’s not quite right.

**Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Same pattern as before, but with a slightly heavier snare on beat 2.  
- The hihat starts to push forward, like it’s trying to break free.

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
You start the motif. It’s simple, but it *sings*.

**Melody:**  
- **F** (beat 1)  
- **G** (beat 2, a quarter note)  
- **E♭** (beat 3, eighth note)  
- **F** (beat 4, eighth note, held with a slight breath in the middle)  

It’s not a scale run. It’s a question. A memory. A story that hasn’t resolved yet.

**Space matters.** You leave the last note hanging — a breath between the past and the future.

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax) – Resolution**  
You come back, finish the motif, but you don’t *end* it. You imply it, like you're about to say something but the room is too heavy with anticipation.

**Melody:**  
- **F** (beat 1)  
- **G** (beat 2, eighth note)  
- **E♭** (beat 3, eighth note)  
- **F** (beat 4, quarter note, with a subtle vibrato that fades)  

The last note lingers — a whisper, a sigh — and then… silence.

**Result:**  
The intro feels like a door just opening — not fully, but enough to see what's on the other side. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The room holds its breath. You’ve made the first step into something new.
