**Title: "Question in F"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 4 bars (6 seconds)**  
**Mood: Tense, searching, then resolute.**

---

**Bar 1: (Little Ray – Drums)**  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3.  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4.  
- **Hi-Hat:** On every eighth note.  
- **But:** On beat 3, he **holds** the hi-hat open for a half-beat, creating a **sudden silence** just before the snare.  
- **Effect:** A question in rhythm, like a pause mid-sentence.

---

**Bar 2: (Marcus – Bass)**  
- **Chromatic descent from F to E♭**, then a **half-step resolution to D**.  
- **Line:** F → E♭ → D → C# → D → E♭ → F  
- **Feel:** Searching, unresolved, but purposeful.  
- **Chord:** F7 (F, A, C, E).  
- **Note choice:** He avoids the root on beat 1, letting the chord **happen in space**.

---

**Bar 3: (Diane – Piano)**  
- **Comping on 2 and 4.**  
- **Left hand:** Rootless 7th chords, moving from B♭7 (B♭, D, F, A) to A7 (A, C#, E, G).  
- **Right hand:** A **fragmented melodic line**, slightly behind the beat.  
- **Phrase:** A descending line from A to G to F, then a **sustained C#** on beat 3.  
- **Effect:** She’s not playing the melody yet — she’s **setting up the space** for it.

---

**Bar 4: (Dante – Tenor Saxophone)**  
- **Motif:**  
  - **Beat 1:** A sustained **F**, held just past the beat.  
  - **Beat 2:** A **B♭**, then a **half-step down to A**.  
  - **Beat 3:** A **D** (the 5th of the key), held with **tension**.  
  - **Beat 4:** A **G**, resolving to the **F** of the key, **but just before the beat** — leaving it hanging.  
- **Phrasing:** The line is **sparse**, **emotional**, and **modern** — not a scale run, but a **question answered with a memory**.  
- **Effect:** It’s not the melody you expect — it’s **something new**, something **Wayne** might recognize as the sound of a **new voice**.

---

**Final Effect:**
- The first bar is a **rhythmic question**, the bass answers with **searching chromatics**, the piano sets up **emotional space**, and the saxophone delivers a **motif that lingers**.
- It’s not just a intro — it’s a **statement**.
- And for the first time tonight, **Wayne Shorter** leans forward.
