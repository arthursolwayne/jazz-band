**Dm Intro – 4 Bars – 160 BPM – Key of Dm – 4/4 Time**

**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Set the mood — sparse, haunting, with a ghost in the room.*  

- Kick: On 1 and 3 (low, deep, with a slight delay on the third to make it feel like a memory).  
- Snare: On 2 and 4 (snappy, but with a dry, slightly muted sound).  
- Hi-hat: On every eighth note, but with a decaying sustain — like a whisper fading into silence.  
- Space: A half-beat rest on the last eighth of the bar (before the snare on beat 4), to create tension.  

**Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**  
*7th chords, comp on 2 and 4 — with a twist.*  

- Dm7 (D-F-A-C) on beat 2, with a chromatic approach from C# on the "and" of 1.  
- F#dim7 (F#-A-C-D) on beat 4 — a surprising, tense voicing that hints at a key shift or a question.  
- Right hand: A single, dissonant note (C#) on the "and" of 3, unresolved.  
- Left hand: Walking bass line — D-C-Bb-A (chromatic descent), then back up to D on beat 4.  

**Bar 3: Marcus (Bass)**  
*Walking line with chromatic approaches — never the same note twice.*  

- D-C-Bb-A (chromatic descent) on beats 1-4.  
- On the "and" of 2, a chromatic approach from C to D.  
- On the "and" of 3, a half-step above the root (E) — a ghost note, not played, but felt.  
- On the "and" of 4, a low A, resolving down to D.  

**Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax)**  
*One short motif, make it sing — leave it hanging. No scale runs, just emotion and space.*  

- Play a single note on beat 1: **F#** (a note from the F#dim7 chord Diane just played), held for two beats.  
- Let it ring, let it question.  
- On the "and" of 3, a short, staccato **D** — a return to the tonic, but not quite resolved.  
- End on an open **D** on beat 4 — but don’t play it. Let it rest. Let the silence speak.

**Result:**  
A question in the air. A note that lingers like a memory. A space that dares Wayne Shorter to lean forward. This isn’t a resolution — it’s the beginning of something new. Something that could go anywhere.  
And that’s the point.
