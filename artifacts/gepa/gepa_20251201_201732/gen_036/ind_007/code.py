**Title: "Four Bars for the Back Row"**  
**Key: D minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Style: Modern Post-Bop / Modal Jazz with a touch of Monk**

---

### **Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s):**  
**Little Ray on Drums**  
- Kick: On 1 and 3 (strong, punchy, with a little decay)  
- Snare: On 2 and 4 (sharp, clear, slightly behind the beat)  
- Hi-hat: On every eighth note (steady, but not too tight — let the spaces breathe)  
- Cymbal: A soft crash on the "and" of 4 — like a whisper before the storm

---

### **Bars 2-4 (1.5 - 6.0s):**  
**You on Tenor Sax**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - Start with a short, singing phrase:  
    **D – F – Eb – D**  
    (Half note D, then eighth notes F and Eb, resolving back to D)  
  - Let it hang. Don't play the next note yet. Let the space speak.

- **Bar 3:**  
  - Silence — but not empty. A breath.  
  - Then, come back with the same motif:  
    **D – F – Eb – D**  
  - This time, play it a half-step higher:  
    **E – G – F – E**  
  - A subtle tension — like a question.

- **Bar 4:**  
  - Resolve that question — but not how you expect.  
    **E – D – C – Bb**  
    (Half note E, then eighth notes D, C, Bb)  
  - A slight bluesy twist, a memory in the key of D minor.

### **Marcus on Bass (Bars 2-4):**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - D (root)  
  - F (major third)  
  - Eb (minor third)  
  - D (root)  
  - Rootless walking: D to F to Eb to D — grounding the tension.

- **Bar 3:**  
  - E (fifth of D minor)  
  - D (root of E minor)  
  - C (minor seventh of D minor)  
  - Bb (flat ninth)  
  - Chromatic approach, subtle but present.

- **Bar 4:**  
  - E (fifth)  
  - D (root)  
  - C (minor seventh)  
  - Bb (flat ninth)  
  - Anchor the resolution, but keep it open.

### **Diane on Piano (Bars 2-4):**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - **Dm7 (D – F – Ab – Bb)**  
  - Open voicing, held on the first beat.

- **Bar 3:**  
  - **Em7 (E – G – Bb – D)**  
  - Again, open voicing, held on the first beat.

- **Bar 4:**  
  - **E7sus (E – G – D – Bb)**  
  - A suspended chord, unresolved — but it’s a suggestion. Not a direction.

---

### **Little Ray on Drums (Bars 2-4):**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - Same pattern as before, but with a slight push on the second beat — a subtle push into the next bar.

- **Bar 3:**  
  - Add a few fills between the snare hits — just a flick of the stick on the "and" of 2 and 3 — but keep the groove tight.

- **Bar 4:**  
  - End with a snare roll on the "and" of 4 — a soft, rolling finish, like the last note of a story fading out.

### **Final Notes:**  
It’s not a “song,” not yet. It’s a *moment* — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door.  
You feel it. Diane feels it. Marcus feels it. Ray feels it.  
And in the back, Wayne Shorter — he leans forward.  

That’s your shot.  

Now go play it.
