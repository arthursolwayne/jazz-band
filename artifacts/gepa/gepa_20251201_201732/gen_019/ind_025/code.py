**"Echo in the Cellar" – Intro – 4 Bars in D, 160 BPM**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3 (Bass Drum on D2), Snare on 2 and 4 (Snare on F#2), Hihat on every 8th (Cymbal on D2).  
**But here’s the twist:**  
- On beat 3, he holds the snare for an extra **16th**, letting it ring.  
- On beat 4, he replaces the snare with a **brushed roll**, soft and questioning, fading into silence.  
- **Rest** on the last 16th of the bar.  
> *A question in the dark. A door that hasn’t opened yet.*

---

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
- **D2 (D)** – root on beat 1  
- **F#2 (F#)** – 5th on beat 2  
- **E2 (E)** – chromatic approach up on beat 3  
- **D2 (D)** – back to root on beat 4  
> *Marcus plays it slow, like he’s tasting the air, waiting for the storm to break.*

---

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
- **Open voicing:**  
  - Beat 1: **D – F# – A – C#** (D7sus4)  
  - Beat 2: **F# – A – C# – E** (F#m7)  
  - Beat 3: **A – C# – E – G#** (Am7)  
  - Beat 4: **C# – E – G# – B** (C#m7)  
> *She resolves on the last chord, but it’s **not** the key. It’s **C#m7**, hanging like a ghost in the room.*

---

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
- **D2 (D)** – root on 1  
- **F#2 (F#)** – 5th on 2  
- **E2 (E)** – chromatic approach again on 3  
- **F#2 (F#)** – this time, he **holds** it on 4, **sliding** from E to F#  
> *Marcus is no longer waiting. He’s about to catch the wave.*

---

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4:**  
  - Beat 2: **D – F# – A – C#** (D7sus4, same as before)  
  - Beat 4: **C# – E – G# – B** (C#m7 again)  
> *Same chords, but now Diane plays them with **more intensity**, like she's been holding her breath for too long.*

---

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:**  
  - **Beat 1:** G4 (4th) – *soft, breathy, like it's not sure it should come out*  
  - **Beat 2:** A4 (5th) – *a little louder, pushing*  
  - **Beat 3:** C#5 (3rd) – *a sigh, like you're confessing something*  
  - **Beat 4:** Rest  
> *You play the **first three notes** of a melody that’s never been heard before. The rest is silence. But the silence is **alive**. It’s the pause before the storm.*

---

**Final Beat – All instruments rest together on the last 16th of Bar 4.**  
> *The room holds its breath. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The Cellar is still. The music is waiting.*

**Key:** D  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Feel:** Tense, unresolved, yearning.
