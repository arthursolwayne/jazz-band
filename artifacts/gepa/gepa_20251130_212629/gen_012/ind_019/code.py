**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on every eighth.  
But here’s the twist: On the **& of 2**, he plays a fill — just a single open hi-hat, held for a half-beat. Then nothing until the end of the bar.  
It’s a breath, a pause, a question mark.  
*The room holds its breath.*

**Bar 2 – Full Band Enters (F Major):**  
**Diane (Piano):**  
- On beat 2 (the "& of 2"), Diane plays a B♭7 chord (B♭, D, F, A).  
- On beat 4, she plays a G7 chord (G, B, D, F).  
- She holds both chords for a full beat, with a slight decay on the G7, as if letting it fade into the air.  
*The emotion is there, but it’s not loud — it’s listening.*

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- On beat 1: D (chromatic approach to F).  
- Beat 2: E♭ (chromatic approach to D).  
- Beat 3: F.  
- Beat 4: G (chromatic approach to A).  
- Then a half-note on G, holding the tension.  
*He’s the river — slow, steady, never the same path twice.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- On beat 1: F (long, open, singing).  
- Beat 2: D (a quarter note, descending stepwise).  
- Beat 3: B♭ (a half note, suspended, open).  
- Beat 4: Rest.  
*You end on a question. A note hanging in the air. A memory walking through the door.*

**Bar 3 – Full Band (F Major):**  
**Diane (Piano):**  
- On beat 1: A7 chord (A, C, E, G).  
- Beat 2: D7 chord (D, F, A, C).  
- Beat 3: F7 chord (F, A, C, E).  
- Beat 4: G7 chord (G, B, D, F).  
*She’s painting the air with emotion, not noise.*

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- On beat 1: A (chromatic approach to B♭).  
- Beat 2: B♭ (chromatic approach to A).  
- Beat 3: C (chromatic approach to B).  
- Beat 4: D (chromatic approach to C).  
*Still moving, still never repeating the same note twice.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- On beat 1: B♭ (a short note, like a whisper).  
- Beat 2: A (a quarter note, descending again).  
- Beat 3: G (a half note, bending slightly, like a sigh).  
- Beat 4: Rest.  
*You’re not resolving. You’re building. You’re waiting.*

---

**Bar 4 – Full Band (F Major):**  
**Diane (Piano):**  
- On beat 1: C7 chord (C, E, G, B).  
- Beat 2: F7 chord (F, A, C, E).  
- Beat 3: G7 chord (G, B, D, F).  
- Beat 4: A7 chord (A, C, E, G).  
*She’s pushing the air forward, setting the stage for what’s coming next.*

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- On beat 1: E (chromatic approach to F).  
- Beat 2: F (chromatic approach to E).  
- Beat 3: G (chromatic approach to A).  
- Beat 4: A (chromatic approach to B♭).  
*Still moving — still the anchor.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Beat 1: F (a long, open note — the same one from the beginning).  
- Beat 2: D (a quarter note, descending again).  
- Beat 3: B♭ (a half note, the same as before).  
- Beat 4: F (a full note, resolving — but not fully. It’s a whisper of an answer to a question that was never asked.)  
*You finish it — but not in the way he expected.*

**Final Note:**  
You leave the stage with the last note still in the air — a note that feels like a memory, not a resolution.  
And in the back, Wayne Shorter is leaning forward, eyes open, whiskey untouched.  
He’s heard something he hasn’t heard before.  
And he’s smiling.
