### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On beats 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Feel:** Tight, urgent, but not rushed. The energy is *pulling* the room in — like a door about to creak open.

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax)** – The four-bar melody  
**Motif: A question, a breath, a beginning.**  

**Bar 2:**  
- **Beat 1:** **F** (tenor)  
- **Beat 2:** **A♭** (dampened, like a sigh)  
- **Beat 3:** **C** (held, open)

- **Beat 2:** **G** (chromatic twist)

- **Beat 4:** **B♭** (another question — but softer, like a memory)  

**Bar 4:**  
- **Beat 1:** **C** (bold, unexpected)  
- **Beat 2:** **D♭** (chromatic pull)  
- **Beat 3:** **E♭** (low, haunting)  
- **Beat 4:** *Rest* — *a breath held, a silence that speaks louder than notes.*

> *You end on a rest, not a note. A question. A story that begins with silence.*

### **Final Moment**  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- The room is silent.  
- Diane’s last chord fades, Marcus’ G♭ lingers, and your tenor leaves the last note hanging in the air like a thought not yet said.

**That’s the intro.**  
Now, the rest of the song — if it comes — will be built from that silence.
