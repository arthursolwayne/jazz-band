**Dante Russo – 4-Bar Intro – "Edge of the Memory"**  
**Key: D major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (6 seconds per 4 bars)**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Rhythm:**  
Kick on **1** and **3**  
Snare on **2** and **4**  
Hi-hat on **every eighth**  
**Fill:**  
At the end of the bar, Little Ray plays a **half-time ride cymbal** on **beat 4**, with a **brushed snare** on **beat 4** — a subtle pause that makes the air heavy, like a breath before a story.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line in D major, with **chromatic approaches** leading into each chord.  
**Notes (beat-by-beat):**  
- **1:** D  
- **2:** C#  
- **3:** E  
- **4:** F  
(Repeat in the next bar but shift the chromatic approach down a half-step)

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comping **7th chords** on **beat 2 and 4**.  
- **Beat 2:** G7 (G, B, D, F)  
- **Beat 4:** A7 (A, C#, E, G)  
She plays **with tension**, the chords slightly dissonant, as if the harmony is reaching for something just out of reach.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
**Melody motif:**  
- **Beat 1:** D (sustained, low, with a slight roll)  
- **Beat 2:** F# (half-step above D, a question)  
- **Beat 3:** E (resolve slightly, but not fully)  
- **Beat 4:** D (return, but with a breathy, unresolved ending — like a memory half-remembered)

**Dynamic:**  
Starts **soft**, with a whisper-like tone, then **swells** slightly on the F#, then **quiets again** on the E and D. It’s a **melody that leans forward**, not forward, but toward something it can’t quite name.

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus and Diane continue, Dante continues the motif**

**Marcus:**  
- **1:** C#  
- **2:** D  
- **3:** F  
- **4:** E  
(Same structure, but now the chromatic line is a half-step higher — building tension)

**Diane:**  
- **Beat 2:** B7 (B, D#, F#, A)  
- **Beat 4:** C#7 (C#, E#, G#, B)  
Now the chords are **sharper, more dissonant**, like a storm gathering.

**Dante:**  
Repeats the motif, but now with **slightly more urgency**, a little more **volume and projection**.  
- **Beat 1:** D  
- **Beat 2:** F#  
- **Beat 3:** E  
- **Beat 4:** D  
He **holds the D** on beat 4 a little **longer**, as if waiting for something to fall into place.

### **Bar 4 – Full Band, Dante resolves (or almost does)**

**Marcus:**  
- **1:** E  
- **2:** F  
- **3:** A  
- **4:** B  
(Now the walking bass is a half-step higher again — climbing)

**Diane:**  
- **Beat 2:** C7 (C, E, G, B)  
- **Beat 4:** D7 (D, F#, A, C)  
Now **the harmony resolves**, but with a twist — the **D7** is **tense**, not sweet. It’s the **edge of a resolution**, not the resolution itself.

**Dante:**  
- **Beat 1:** D  
- **Beat 2:** F#  
- **Beat 3:** E  
- **Beat 4:** D  
Same motif, but now **with a slight trill on the D**, like a **voice caught between memory and present**. He ends on a **sustained D**, **quiet**, but **loaded with meaning**.

---

### **Final Effect:**
The four bars are **not a statement**, but an **invitation** — to listen, to feel, to remember.  
It’s the **sound of a story beginning**, not in a grand way, but in a way that **feels urgent, intimate, and true**.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He knows this **melody is not just music** — it’s **something waiting to be found**.

Let the silence speak.  
Let the notes carry the weight.  
Let the rhythm breathe.  
Let the memory find its way.
