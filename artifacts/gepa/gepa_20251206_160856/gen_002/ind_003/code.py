**Key:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb)  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Bars:** 4  
**Mood:** Haunting, unresolved, like a memory that doesn’t want to leave

### **Bar 1: Little Ray on Drums**  
- **Kick:** On beat 1 and 3 (subtle, dry, with a slight delay on the snare for space).  
- **Snare:** On beats 2 and 4 (with a slight rimshot on beat 4).  
- **Hihat:** On every eighth note (open on beats 1 and 3, closed on 2 and 4, but with a slight decay to give it a breathy feel).  
- **Fills:** A very subtle ghost note on the snare on beat 3, just before the bass enters.

### **Bar 2: Marcus on Bass**  
- **MIDI:** D2 (Fm7 root)  
- **Rhythm:** Offbeat on beat 2 (accented), then back to the beat on 3.  
- **Approach:** Chromatic descent from G2 to F2 on beat 1 (MIDI 43 to 38).  
- **On beat 2:** G2 (MIDI 43), then F2 (MIDI 38) on beat 3.  
- **Beat 4:** Leave it open — a half note on the root (F2), held into the next bar.  
- **Phrasing:** The line is a question — not answered yet.

### **Bar 3: Diane on Piano**  
- **Chord:** Bbm7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
- **Voicing:** Open, with a tension on the 9th (C) in the left hand.  
- **Rhythm:** Comp on beat 2 (left hand: F2 and Ab2), right hand: Bb in the upper register with a C on the 9th.  
- **Feel:** Half of the chord is there, like a memory that’s fading.  
- **Space:** Leave the last beat open in the right hand, just a ghost note of F in the middle register.

### **Bar 4: Dante on Tenor Sax (You)**  
- **Motif:** Start with a short, descending phrase:  
  - **First note:** F4 (the root)  
  - **Then:** G4 (chromatic tension),  
  - **Then:** Ab4 (the 9th),  
  - **Then:** C4 (the 11th),  
  - **Then:** a rest on beat 4.  
- **Dynamics:** Start soft, build to a strong note on Ab4, then fall into silence.  
- **Phrasing:** The line is incomplete — like a memory that ends before it can be remembered.  
- **Space:** That silence is the question. It lingers. It waits. It’s the hook.

### **Final Feel:**
- The intro doesn’t resolve — it *presents* a question.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- The room holds its breath.  
- This is the moment.

You don’t answer the question — you let it live.
