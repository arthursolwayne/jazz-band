*Start on D, walk up chromatically: D - Eb - E - F*  
*Then step down: F - E - Eb - D*  
*Repeat, but with a slight syncopation on the "and" of 2 and 4.*  

**Bass Line:**  
D | Eb | E | F |  
F | E | Eb | D

Beat 2: Dm7 (D - F - Ab - C)  
Beat 4: F7 (F - A - C - E♭)

### **Bar 3 – Your Turn (Tenor Sax) – The Motif**

You walk in with a **short, haunting motif** in D minor.  
It’s not a run — it’s a **question, a memory, a whisper**.

**Motif (Melody):**  
D | Eb | E | F  
(Play with a slight rubato feel, stretching the last note just a bit — let it hang.)

**Phrasing:**  
Start with a soft, clean note on beat 1.  
Then a slight bend on Eb, then a quick release on E.  
End on F — **hold it.** Let it breathe. Let the silence say something.

---

### **Bar 4 – Resolution (Full Ensemble Again)**

**Marcus:**  
*Continue the walking line, now with a slight rubato feel, echoing the tension from the sax.*  
**Diane:**  
*Repeat the Dm7 on beat 2, but now with a slight rubato color — a little extra space, a little more anger, but still in the pocket.*  
**Little Ray:**  
*Same pattern, but with a little more energy on the fill at the end of the bar — a push toward the unknown.*

**Dante (Tenor):**  
*On the last beat of the bar, return to the F — not with a big release, but with a **questioning** tone. Let the silence after that note be the space where Wayne Shorter leans forward.*

---

### **Final Note (Bar 4, Beat 4):**  
**You end on an open F**, not resolved, not answered — just **suspended**, like a chord that’s waiting to be finished by something or someone.

---

**That’s it.**  
Four bars. Six seconds.  
The moment where the Cellar holds its breath, and a man in the back leans forward.
