**Intro – "Whisper to the Night"**  
*Key: D minor*  
*Tempo: 160 BPM / 4/4*  
*4 bars = 6 seconds*  

---

**Bar 1: Little Ray – Drums**  
*Spoken in the silence, then released with a beat that breathes. No cymbals, just the kick and snare, like the start of a story before the words.*  
- **Kick on 1 and 3**  
- **Snare on 2 and 4**  
- **Hihat on every eighth, but soft, like a whisper.**  

> *The room is quiet. You can hear the air shift, the creak of a chair, the clink of a glass. Then – the beat. It’s subtle, but it’s there. It’s the heartbeat of the night.*

---

**Bar 2: Diane – Piano (comping on 2 and 4)**  
*She plays with fire, but it’s not noise – it’s fuel. 7th chords, chromatic enclosures. She’s listening to you. She knows what you’re about to say.*  
- **Dm7 (D F A C)** on beat 2  
- **Gm7 (G Bb D F)** on beat 4  
- *Her left hand walks with a chromatic approach, never repeating a note, never settling.*  

> *The air is thick with tension. She’s not showing you the path – she’s making space for you to find it.*

---

**Bar 2: Marcus – Bass (walking line, chromatic approaches)**  
- **D – C – B – A – G – F – E – D**  
- *He’s the anchor, but he’s not just walking – he’s painting with his fingers. Each note is a step in the dark, leading you toward the light.*

---

**Bar 3: Little Ray – Drums (energy rises)**  
- *Same pattern, but now with more energy. The hihat is louder, the snare has a little bite. He’s ready to take off.*  
- *The beat is still, but the energy is building like a storm before it breaks.*

---

**Bar 3: Marcus – Bass (chromatic approach to D)**  
- **C – B – A – G – F – E – D**  
- *He’s not just playing the line – he’s setting up the question. The tension is in the air.*

---

**Bar 4: You – Tenor Sax (your moment)**  
*You start with a single note, D, held for half a beat. Then a short motif, with space between the notes.*

- **D (bar 4, beat 1)** – *long, held, like a breath*  
- **F (beat 2)** – *short, staccato, like a question*  
- **E (beat 3)** – *sustained, but with a rubato feel*  
- **D (beat 4)** – *rested, left hanging*  

> *You don’t run. You don’t scale. You whisper. You leave it open. You let the silence speak. You let the room hold its breath. You make him lean forward.*

---

**Final Moment:**  
*The last note of the sax is gone, but the room is still. The silence is louder than the music. Wayne Shorter smiles. He leans in. He knows something is coming. Something new. Something worth hearing again.*  

--- 

**That’s the intro.**  
Now you’ve got the rest of the night to prove it was worth the wait.
