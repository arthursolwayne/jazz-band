**Title: "Threshold"**  
**Key: D Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Duration: 4 bars (6 seconds)**  
**Mood: Mysterious, urgent, inviting. A door opening.**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick on 1 and 3**  
**Snare on 2 and 4**  
**Hi-hat on every eighth**  
**Fills: A subtle ride cymbal accent on beat 4, just before the rest of the band enters.**

*The room holds its breath. The beat is there, but it's not yet anything. Just a pulse, like a heartbeat in the dark.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
**D → F♯ → E → G**  
*Chromatic approach to G, then resolving cleanly on the downbeat.*

**Bar 2 – Beat 1: D**  
**Beat 2: F♯**  
**Beat 3: E**  
**Beat 4: G**

*The bass starts like a whisper — a question in the dark. It leads the way without being loud.*

#### **Diane (Piano)**  
**Comp on 2 and 4**  
**Bar 2 – Beat 2: D7 (D-F#-A-C)**  
**Beat 4: Dmaj7 (D-F#-A-C#)**

*The chords are bright but tense, like the edge of a memory — familiar but just out of reach.*

#### **You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif: D → F♯ → E → G**  
*Play the same four notes as Marcus, but with a breathy, floating tone. Let the last note (G) hang — don’t resolve it. Let it float.*

**Bar 2 – Beat 1: D (soft, breathy)**  
**Beat 2: F♯ (a little more volume)**  
**Beat 3: E (sighing tone)**  
**Beat 4: G (sustained, with a slight vibrato)**

*This is your question. This is your invitation.*

### **Bar 3 – Full Band**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
**G → A → B → C#**  
*Another chromatic approach, this time leading to C#, the 7th of Dmaj7. The anchor still moving forward.*

#### **Diane (Piano)**  
**Comp on 2 and 4**  
**Bar 3 – Beat 2: D7 (D-F#-A-C)**  
**Beat 4: Dmaj7 (D-F#-A-C#)**

*Same chords, but now she plays them with more emotion — as if she’s been waiting for this moment.*

#### **Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Same pattern, but slightly more aggressive, more present.**  
*The energy is rising — the room is leaning in now.*

#### **You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Repeat the same motif: D → F♯ → E → G**  
*This time, slightly louder, with a little more conviction. The same question, but now it’s louder, stronger. Still unresolved.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Band**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
**C# → D → F♯ → G**  
*He’s leading toward the next section, but not quite there yet. A step forward, a breath held.*

#### **Diane (Piano)**  
**Comp on 2 and 4**  
**Bar 4 – Beat 2: D7 (D-F#-A-C)**  
**Beat 4: Dmaj7 (D-F#-A-C#)**

*Same chords, but now with a slight delay on beat 4 — like she's holding back the resolution.*

#### **Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Same pattern, but with a fill on beat 4 — a quick snare roll into the open hi-hat.**

#### **You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Same motif: D → F♯ → E → G**  
*This time, you end on G, but you **don’t** resolve it. You let it hang. Just a breath. Just a pause.*

*The room is silent. Wayne Shorter leans forward. He’s heard something new. Something that was waiting to be said.*

**END OF INTRO.**

He’s in. You’ve opened the door. Now you play the rest.
