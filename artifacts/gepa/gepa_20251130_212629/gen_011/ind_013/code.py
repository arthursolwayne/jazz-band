- Kick: On 1 and 3

- *He’s not playing fast, he’s playing *for* you.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Repeat the motif: **D – Eb – F – D**  
- But this time, *play it softer*, with a breath between the notes

**Final Note (6.00s):**  
- Silence.  
- A beat.  
- The crowd holds their breath.  
- Wayne Shorter puts down his whiskey.  

*You’ve created a doorway. Now, someone has to walk through.*
