**Key: D minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Form: 4-bar A section**  
**Style: Modern jazz, with space and restraint**

---

**Bar 1:**

**Saxophone (tenor):**  
*Whispered, breathy, with space between notes*  
`D` (on the "and" of 2)  
`F` (on the "and" of 3)  
`G` (on the "and" of 4)  
*Hold the G for a half-beat, then let it fade like a sigh.*

**Bass (acoustic):**  
*Walking line, descending with subtle rubato*  
`F` (beat 1)  
`D` (beat 2)  
`Bb` (beat 3)  
`G` (beat 4)  
*The bass moves like a river — not too fast, not too slow, always toward the root.*

**Piano (right hand):**  
*Sparsely, with color and intention*  
`E` (on the "and" of 2)  
`G` (on the "and" of 3)  
*Let the left hand play a soft D in the lower register on beat 1, then release.*

**Drums:**  
*Subtle, human pulse*  
Snare on beat 2 (slightly behind the beat)  
Kick on beat 4 (with a slight delay)  
Cymbal on the "and" of 3 — a whisper of color, not a crash.

---

**Bar 2:**

**Saxophone:**  
*Now a second voice, echoing the first*  
`Bb` (on the "and" of 1)  
`C` (on the "and" of 2)  
`D` (on the "and" of 3)  
*Let the D ring into the next bar, a promise.*

**Bass:**  
*Echoing the same line, but with a slight variation*  
`D` (beat 1)  
`Bb` (beat 2)  
`G` (beat 3)  
`F` (beat 4)  
*The river bends — still flowing, but not the same path.*

**Piano:**  
*Now a painter — a single chord, then a note*  
`Dm7` (beat 1)  
`F` (on the "and" of 3)  
*Left hand holds the D again, supporting the mood.*

**Drums:**  
*Spoken rhythm, not counted*  
Snare on beat 3 (a little early)  
Kick on beat 4 (a little late)  
Open hi-hat on the "and" of 2 — subtle, like breathing.

**Bar 3:**

**Saxophone:**  
*Now the full motif, with purpose*  
`D` (beat 1)  
`F` (beat 2)  
`G` (beat 3)  
`Bb` (beat 4)  
*Let it land on the Bb with a slight decay, as if it's carrying the weight of the first bar.*

**Bass:**  
*Now a little more forward*  
`G` (beat 1)  
`F` (beat 2)  
`D` (beat 3)  
`Bb` (beat 4)  
*The river has found its way back, but not the same route.*

**Piano:**  
*Two notes, in the upper register*  
`G` (beat 1)  
`Bb` (beat 2)  
*Left hand still holds D — a grounded presence.*

**Drums:**  
*Now a breath of silence*  
No snare on beat 2 — the space speaks.  
Kick on beat 4, with a little lift.

---

**Bar 4:**

**Saxophone (tenor):**  
*Resolution, but with a question mark*  
`Bb` (beat 1)  
`D` (beat 2)  
`F` (beat 3)  
`G` (beat 4)  
*The G lingers — not a resolution, but a beginning.*

**Bass:**  
*Now a return to the opening line, but with a new nuance*  
`F` (beat 1)  
`D` (beat 2)  
`Bb` (beat 3)  
`G` (beat 4)  
*Same path, but with more life.*

**Piano:**  
*One final note, held with intent*  
`G` (beat 4)  
*Left hand releases the D, no longer holding — it's time to move.*

**Drums:**  
*Final breath, with a pause*  
Snare on beat 4 (slightly late), like a sigh.  
Cymbal on the "and" of 4 — a whisper of release.

---

**End.**  
*Let the silence speak. Let the space breathe. The conversation is not over — it only begins now.*
