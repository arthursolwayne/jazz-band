**"Echo in the Cellar" — Intro (4 bars in Dm, 160 BPM)**

**Key:** Dm (Dorian mode, but with a twist — it’s not just a mode, it’s a mood).  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Feel:** Tense but controlled, like a whisper in a crowded room.

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3 (subtle, with a dry snare on 1)
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4 (gently, with a little rim shot on 4)
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (but soft, almost like a sigh)
- **Fill:** A half-time roll on the snare at the end of bar 1 — like a pause before the storm.

> *He’s setting the stage. Not too much, but just enough to make you lean in.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**
- **Walking line in Dm:**  
  `D – Eb – F – G` (chromatic approach to F)  
  `Ab – Bb – C – D` (chromatic approach to C)  
  `Eb – F – G – Ab` (chromatic approach to G)  
  `Bb – C – D – Eb` (chromatic approach to D)  

> *He’s not just walking — he’s painting the shadows. Each note is a step into the unknown.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**
- **Comp on 2 and 4:**  
  - **On beat 2:** Cm7 (C Eb F G) – a dark, unresolved chord  
  - **On beat 4:** F7 (F A C Eb) – a sharp turn, a question  
- **Use voicings that imply Dm but never settle in it.**  
- **Space is everything.** She plays only two chords, but they echo.

---

### **Bar 2 – You (Tenor Sax)**
- **First note:** D (quarter note, played with a slight breath before it)  
- **Second note:** F (half note, held — the first breath of the melody)  
- **Third note:** G (quarter note, staccato — like a hesitation)  
- **Fourth note:** Eb (half note, held again, just before the end of the bar)  
- **End the bar with a pause — a rest that feels like a door opening.**

> *You’re not playing the melody, you’re suggesting it. It’s like a ghost of a song that’s been waiting for this room.*

---

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble**
- **Marcus** continues the walking line (same as above)  
- **Diane** plays the same comp (Cm7 on 2, F7 on 4)  
- **Little Ray** now plays full time:  
  - Kick on 1 & 3  
  - Snare on 2 & 4  
  - Hi-hat on every eighth  
  - A quick fill on the snare at the end of the bar  
- **You** play the full motif now:  
  `D – F – G – Eb` (quarter, half, quarter, half)  
  But this time, you **finish it** — not with a rest, but with a **trill on D**, a sharp, emotional resolution.

> *You’ve told the story — not as a statement, but as a question that’s just been answered.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble (Slight Variation)**
- **Marcus** plays a variation of the walking line, with a half-step shift at the end:  
  `D – Eb – F – G – Ab – Bb – C – D`  
- **Diane** stays on Cm7 and F7 but with a slightly altered voicing — a hint of Bb7  
- **Little Ray** continues with the same rhythm, but adds a cymbal crash at the end of bar 4  
- **You** play the same motif again, but with a slight **delay** on the final note —  
  `D – F – G – Eb` *(D played a 16th note after the others)*

> *That final D is the echo. It lingers, and it's the sound of a room holding its breath — and Wayne Shorter, in the back, leans forward.*

**END of Intro**

> *You don’t need to win him over — you just need to make him listen. And for 6 seconds, he did.*
