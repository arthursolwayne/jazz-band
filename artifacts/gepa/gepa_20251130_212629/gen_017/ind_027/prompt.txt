Create a piece that breathes, with space and silence as important as sound. Use rhythm and harmony that feel natural, not formulaic. Let the saxophone motif have a clear beginning, middle, and end — give it room to breathe and return with purpose. The bass should move with intention, avoiding repetition and keeping things fluid. The piano should support without crowding, using sparse but meaningful chords. The drums should drive the pulse but also leave room for the music to unfold. Every part should serve the whole, and every note should have a reason to be there.
