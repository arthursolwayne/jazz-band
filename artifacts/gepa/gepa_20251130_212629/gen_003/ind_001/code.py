**Dante Russo – Intro in Dm (4 Bars) – 160 BPM, 4/4 Time**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*No cymbals, just the kick and snare, like a heartbeat in the dark.*  
- **Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On beats 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note, but soft, like a breath.  
- *A pause before the music enters. Let the room hold its breath.*

---

**Bar 2 – Enter the Band:**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- *Walking line in Dm, chromatic approaches to the 3rd and 7th.*  
- **Notes:** D – Eb – C – Bb – A – G – F – E  
- *Start on beat 2, walking up through the changes, never repeating a note.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- *7th chords, comping on beats 2 and 4.*  
- **Chords:** Dm7 (D – F – A – C) on beat 2  
- **Chords:** Gm7 (G – Bb – D – F) on beat 4  
- *She plays with a fire in her fingers, but keeps her ears open for the melody.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- *Same pattern as before, but now with a slight push on the snare on beat 2, pulling the ensemble forward.*

---

**Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- *This is the moment. One short motif, with space between the notes.*  
- **Notes:**  
  - **Beat 1:** D (sustained, low, like a sigh)  
  - **Beat 2:** Rest  
  - **Beat 3:** F (short, sharp, like a question)  
  - **Beat 4:** Rest  

- *Let the rest do the work. This is not a scale run. This is a whisper. A question in the dark. The kind that makes a legend lean forward.*

---

**Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- *You come back and finish the thought.*  
- **Notes:**  
  - **Beat 1:** C (smooth, like a memory)  
  - **Beat 2:** Rest  
  - **Beat 3:** Bb (resonant, like a ghost)  
  - **Beat 4:** D (resolve, but not fully — leave it hanging, just like the room.)

- *Let the final D hang in the air. Let it echo. Let Wayne Shorter hear the story in those four bars. Let it be the moment that changes everything.*

**End of Intro.**  
*The room is still. The music has been heard. Wayne leans back, sips his whiskey, and smiles.*
