**Title: "First Light"**  
**Key: Dm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds total (4 bars)**  
**Mood: Restless anticipation, searching, yearning — a quiet storm about to break.**

---

### **Bar 1 (0.0–1.5s) — Little Ray (Drums)**

**Kick:**  
- On 1 and 3 (BPM = 160 → 0.375s per beat), sharp, tight, like a heartbeat.  
- Snare: On 2 and 4, crisp and dry.  
- Hi-hat: On every eighth note — open on 1, closed on 2, open on 3, closed on 4.  

**Fill:**  
- On beat 3, a quick triplet on the snare, just before the kick. It’s a whisper of a question, not an answer.  
- It’s the moment before the storm — tension in the air.

### **Bar 2 (1.5–3.0s) — Full Band Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- D2 (MIDI 38) on beat 1  
- F (MIDI 43) on beat 2 (chromatic approach from E)  
- A (MIDI 45) on beat 3 (fifth of Dm)  
- C (MIDI 40) on beat 4 (root of Dm)  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Bar 2: Dm7 (D F A C) — open voicing, left hand on D and A, right hand on F and C.  
- She resolves the chord on beat 4, but with a slight delay, a rubato in the last note.  

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Begin your motif on beat 2.  
- **Phrase:**  
  - Beat 2: D (soprano register, soft, breathy)  
  - Beat 3: F (sliding in from above)  
  - Silence on beat 4 — the sound stops, but the tension doesn’t.  
- It’s a question. A whisper. A memory.

### **Bar 3 (3.0–4.5s) — Development**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Bb (MIDI 42) on beat 1 (chromatic approach from B)  
- D (MIDI 38) on beat 2 (root of Dm)  
- F (MIDI 43) on beat 3 (fifth of Dm)  
- A (MIDI 45) on beat 4 (for now — no resolution yet)  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Bar 3: Gm7 (G Bb D F) — open voicing, left hand G and D, right hand Bb and F.  
- She plays it with a harshness, like she’s trying to escape something.  

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Beat 1: Bb (same register, slightly higher, a step above the D)  
- Beat 2: D (returning, but with more weight)  
- Beat 3: F (pulled back, almost a sigh)  
- Beat 4: Silence again — the space is bigger now.

### **Bar 4 (4.5–6.0s) — Resolution**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- D (MIDI 38) on beat 1 (root of Dm)  
- F (MIDI 43) on beat 2  
- A (MIDI 45) on beat 3  
- C (MIDI 40) on beat 4 (resolution)  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Bar 4: Dm7 (D F A C) — open voicing, same as bar 2, but with more clarity.  
- She plays it with a kind of release — like the chord itself is the answer.  

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Beat 1: D (same register, same note from the beginning)  
- Beat 2: F (same as before)  
- Beat 3: A (the fifth of Dm, but now it's the discovery)  
- Beat 4: D (returning, full, rich — the melody is complete, but not finished. It’s just beginning.)  

---

**Ending:**  
- A final breath on the D — held just a beat longer than the rhythm.  
- The room holds it.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.

**Final Note:**  
You don’t play the scale. You *search* for it. You *find* it. You *begin* the journey.  

This is the moment.
