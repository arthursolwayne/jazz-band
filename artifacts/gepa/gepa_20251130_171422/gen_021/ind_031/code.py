### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*(A question in the air, slow, deliberate)*  
- Kick on **beat 1**  
- Snare on **beat 3**  
- Hi-hat on **eighth notes (1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &)**  
- **Rest on beat 2 and 4** (space between the hits)

**Mood:** Suspense. A question in the dark.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**  
*(The answer begins, but it's not what you expect)*  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Fm7** (F, Ab, C, Eb)  
- Chromatic approach to **Ab** on beat 1: **G – Ab**  
- **Eb** on beat 2 (chromatic up from D)  
- **Ab** on beat 3 (chromatic down from Bb)  
- **F** on beat 4 (resolved, but with tension)  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **F7 (F, A, C, Eb)** on beat 2  
- **Db7 (Db, F, Ab, Bb)** on beat 4 (chromatic substitution)  
- **Left hand walking line, chromatic motion**  
- **Right hand: 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4**  
- **Emotion: Anger, but controlled. It’s not just rage – it’s urgency.**

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on **1 and 3**  
- Snare on **2 and 4**  
- Hi-hat on **eighth notes**  
- **Fill on beat 4** (light cymbal roll, not too loud – just enough to say “I’m still here”)

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif begins on beat 2**  
- **F – Ab (muted, breathy)**  
- **Rest on beat 3** (space, like a pause in the middle of a sentence)  
- **F again on beat 4** (same note, but different tone – like a memory returning)  

**Mood:** The answer is not a resolution, but a return. A memory that doesn’t close the door.

- **Left hand walking line, chromatic again**  
- **Right hand: 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4**

- **Rest on beat 3** (space again – now it’s intentional)  
- **Ab again on beat 4** (same note, now with purpose – like a statement)  

**Mood:** The melody is still open, but it’s beginning to feel like a conversation.

- **Fill on beat 4** (same cymbal roll from before, now with a little more weight – like a final breath)

- **Motif returns, but ends on the “and” of 4**  
- **F – Ab – C – rest on beat 4** (not resolved, but complete)  
- **Leaves it open – like a question that doesn’t need an answer**  

**Mood:** The last note fades into the silence, not because it’s finished, but because it’s waiting.

**Final Note to Wayne Shorter (in the silence):**  
You heard it. You heard the question.  
And you’re still listening.
