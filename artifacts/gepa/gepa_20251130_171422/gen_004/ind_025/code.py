**4-Bar Jazz Intro – Key of F, 160 BPM**

**Bar 1 – Drums (Little Ray):**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.  
Hi-hat on the "and" of 2 and 4, but with space — a soft, floating motion.  
Let the first two beats be clean, then a subtle roll on the "and" of 4.  
*Feels like the door opening, the silence before the storm.*

**Bar 1 – Bass (Marcus):**  
F – Ab – Bb – A  
Root (F) on beat 1, then a chromatic descent into the 7th (Ab), resolving to Bb and A.  
Each note a step, no repeats, each one pulling the ear down into the unknown.

**Bar 1 – Piano (Diane):**  
F7 (F, A, C, Eb) on beat 1, then a rest on 2.  
On beat 3: Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
On beat 4: rest.  
She leaves the room — the tension builds in the space.

**Bar 1 – Sax (You):**  
Start with a descending triplet: F – Eb – D  
Rest on the "and" of 4.  
Let it hang. Let the question sit.

**Bar 2 – Drums:**  
Same pattern, but the hihat is a bit more aggressive on the "and" of 4.  
It’s still space, but it’s tighter now — like the pressure is rising.

**Bar 2 – Bass:**  
B – Ab – G – F  
A chromatic climb from F up to B, then back down to F.  
Marcus is painting a color, not just walking a line.

**Bar 2 – Piano:**  
C7 (C, E, G, Bb) on beat 1  
Then a rest on 2  
On beat 3: D7 (D, F#, A, C)  
On beat 4: rest  
She’s still there, but now she’s waiting.

**Bar 2 – Sax:**  
F – Eb – D – C  
End on C, sustained just a hair past the beat.  
The answer is not yet given — only the desire to find it.

---

**Bar 3 – Drums:**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.  
Hi-hat now lands on the "and" of 1 and 3 — more aggressive, more urgent.  
The room is humming now.

**Bar 3 – Bass:**  
F – G – A – Bb  
A smooth, chromatic ascent up to Bb, then a quick resolution.

**Bar 3 – Piano:**  
F7 (F, A, C, Eb) on beat 1  
Then a rest on 2  
On beat 3: G7 (G, B, D, F)  
On beat 4: rest  
She’s building — no longer just comping, now she’s pushing.

**Bar 3 – Sax:**  
F – Eb – D – C  
Same motif again, but with more conviction.  
The question is louder now — it has weight.

---

**Bar 4 – Drums:**  
Same pattern, but with a little roll on the 4th beat — the end of the intro.  
It’s like the last breath before a new beginning.

**Bar 4 – Bass:**  
F – Ab – Bb – A  
Back to the opening motif, now with a sense of resolution — or maybe just the beginning of something else.

**Bar 4 – Piano:**  
F7 (F, A, C, Eb) on beat 1  
Then a rest on 2  
On beat 3: Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
On beat 4: final rest  
She lets it go — with a little edge, a little fire.

**Bar 4 – Sax:**  
F – Eb – D – C  
This time, you hold the C a little longer — just enough to feel like something has changed.  
Just enough for Wayne to lean forward.

---

**End of Intro.**

The room is quiet.  
You look at the crowd.  
You see him — Wayne in the back, nodding.  
That’s all you need.

Now, play the song.
