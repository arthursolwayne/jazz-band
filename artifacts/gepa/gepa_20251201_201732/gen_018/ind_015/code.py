---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit:**  
- Kick on 1 & 3  
- Snare on 2 & 4  
- Hi-hats on every eighth note  
- Subtle cymbal swells under the snare on beat 2 and 4  
- Leave space on the "and" of 3; make it feel like a held breath  

**Feel:** Suspenseful, tight, building energy. The silence between the eighth notes is louder than the sound.

---

### **Bar 2: Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line (F2 - Bb2 - C3 - D3 - F3)**  
**Notes (MIDI 38-43):**  
- **F2** (beat 1)  
- **Bb2** (beat 2) – chromatic approach from A2  
- **C3** (beat 3)  
- **D3** (beat 4)  
- **F3** (beat 1 of next bar, resolving on the "and" of 3)  

**Feel:** Pulse of the heartbeat. Subtle tension in the approach to C3. Roots and fifths only. No filler.

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano) – Open Voicing**  
**Chord:** **Fmaj7 (F, A, C, E)**  
- Root on beat 1  
- Drop 2 voicing: **A, C, E, F**  
- Resolve on beat 4, then leave the chord hanging with a **C** in the right hand, unresolved.

**Feel:** Storm on the horizon. Open, spacious, with a chord that feels like the edge of a cliff.

### **Bar 3: Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line (F2 - G2 - Ab2 - Bb2 - C3)**  
**Notes (MIDI 38-43):**  
- **F2** (beat 1)  
- **G2** (beat 2) – chromatic approach from Gb2  
- **Ab2** (beat 3)  
- **Bb2** (beat 4)  
- **C3** (beat 1 of next bar)  

**Feel:** The tension grows. A hint of minor in the Gb2 -> Ab2 movement. Marcus is the anchor, but not the center.

---

### **Bar 3: Diane (Piano) – Open Voicing**  
**Chord:** **Am7 (A, C, E, G)**  
- Drop 2 voicing: **C, E, G, A**  
- Right hand: **A** on beat 3, **G** on beat 4, lingering.

**Feel:** The storm gets closer. The harmony shifts, but never resolves — it just moves.

---

### **Bar 4: Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line (F2 - Bb2 - C3 - D3 - F3)**  
**Same as Bar 2, but with subtle vibrato on the D3.**  
**Feel:** The resolution is just out of reach.

---

### **Bar 4: Diane (Piano) – Open Voicing**  
**Chord:** **Fmaj7 (F, A, C, E)**  
- Drop 2 voicing: **A, C, E, F**  
- Resolve on beat 4, but Diane holds the **E** in the right hand, letting it ring out.

**Feel:** The storm has passed, but the sky is still dark.

### **Bar 4: Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
**Melody:**  
- **Bar 4, beat 1:** **F (F4)** – soft, breathy, like a whisper  
- **Bar 4, beat 2:** **G (G4)** – a question, almost a sigh  
- **Bar 4, beat 3:** **Ab (Ab4)** – tension, unresolved  
- **Bar 4, beat 4:** **Bb (Bb4)** – a half-step resolution, a moment of clarity  
- **Leave the last note hanging** – don’t resolve to C. Let it sit.

**Feel:** Urgent, unresolved, like a whisper in the dark. You don’t answer the question — you just make it louder.

---

### **Total Feel:**
- **Drums:** Secret.  
- **Bass:** Heartbeat.  
- **Piano:** Storm.  
- **Sax:** Whisper in the dark that Wayne Shorter leans forward to hear.
