---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**
- **Kick**: On 1 and 3  
- **Snare**: On 2 and 4 (light, with a slight roll on 2)  
- **Hi-hat**: On every 8th note (closed, but with a soft, rolling edge on beat 3)  
- **Space**: A few milliseconds of silence before the kick on beat 1 — the room holds its breath.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**

**Marcus (Bass)** – Walking line in Dm, starting on **F** (the 3rd of Dm)  
- F → G → Bb → A → G → F# → E → D  
- Chromatic descent on the last two notes (F# → E)  
- Light touch, barely touching the strings — the groove is there, but it’s *waiting*.

**Diane (Piano)** – Comping on 2 and 4  
- **Bar 2**:  
  - **Beat 2**: Gm7 (G Bb D F)  
  - **Beat 4**: Cm7 (C Eb G Bb)  
- Slight rubato on the 4th beat, subtle delay before the chord hits — like a question.

**Little Ray (Drums)** – Same as before, but now with a **light ride cymbal** on beat 3, just a whisper.

### **Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax)**

**Melody (Dante):**  
> F – F# – E – D  
> (rest) – (rest) – (rest) – (rest)  
> F – F# – E – D  
> (rest) – (rest) – (rest) – (rest)

- **First four notes**: F, F#, E, D — a chromatic descent into the root of Dm  
- **Rests**: A long, empty space between the first and second phrases  
- **Phrasing**: Breath-like, with a slight delay before the second phrase  
- **Tone**: Warm, but with a slight edge — like someone walking through the door, but not yet here  
- **Dynamics**: Soft, but present, like whispering a secret

### **Bar 4 – Full Band Completes the Intro**

**Marcus (Bass)** – Resolves the chromatic line into the **D** of Dm on beat 3  
- D → C → Bb → A  
- Smooth, warm, with a **slight emphasis** on the D on beat 3  
- A moment of release

**Diane (Piano)** – Comping on 2 and 4  
- **Beat 2**: F7 (F A C E)  
- **Beat 4**: Dm7 (D F A C)  
- A subtle trill on the F in the F7 chord — emotion, tension, color

**Little Ray (Drums)** – Same pattern, but with a **light cymbal crash** on beat 4 — a slight *push* toward resolution

**Dante (Tenor Sax)** – Returns with the same motif  
> F – F# – E – D  
- But now **with a little more breath**, a little more **confidence** — as if the idea is now *there*, in the room  
- Ends on the **D** — a question, a door slightly ajar

### **Final Moment**

- Wayne Shorter leans forward, eyes closed, listening
- The room is still, but the energy is alive
- This is the moment — not the end, but the **beginning of something new**

**The intro is done.**  
**The story has begun.**
