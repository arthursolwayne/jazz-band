- **Phrase:**  
  - **Beat 1:** F (long, open, with a slight slur into the next note)  
  - **Beat 2:** G (half-step up, a question)  
  - **Beat 3:** Ab (a step back, a hesitation)  
  - **Beat 4:** Bb (a resolution, but incomplete – a promise, not an answer)  
- **Phrasing:** Let the last note hang – don’t resolve it immediately. Let the silence speak.  
- **Articulation:** Smooth, legato, with a breathy edge – like the wind before a storm

**Final Moment (End of Bar 4):**  
- Little Ray hits a soft open hi-hat on the “and” of beat 4  
- Marcus holds on the Bb  
- Diane leaves the last beat empty  
- You end on a breath, suspended in the air
