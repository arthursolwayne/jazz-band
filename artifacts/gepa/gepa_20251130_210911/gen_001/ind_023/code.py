**Intro – 4 Bars in Dm (D minor), 160 BPM, 4/4 Time**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Space. No cymbals. Just the sound of the room. A kick on beat 1, then nothing. The silence is deliberate. The audience holds their breath. Waynes’s whiskey glass doesn’t move.*

**Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters:**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, chromatic approach on beat 1, lands on D. Then a descending line: D → C → Bb → A. Chromaticism on the 3rd and 4th beats. Never repeats a note. The anchor.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
*Comping on 2 and 4 with minor 7th chords: Dm7 on beat 2, Fm7 on beat 4. Dissonant, but tight. She’s not here to play with you — she’s here to watch you fall or rise.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Now in full motion: kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. The rhythm is tight, but it’s not pushing — it’s *pulling*. The energy is there, but it’s waiting.*

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*You step in with a short, haunting motif: D → F → Eb → D. A question. A memory. It’s not a melody — it’s a ghost. You hold the last note, D, for just a beat longer than it should be. Let the tension sit. Let the room breathe.*

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax) – Resolution (or not):**  
*You come back with the same motif, but altered: D → F → Eb → C. A half-step down on the last note. That’s the twist. You end on a C, leaving it unresolved. It feels like something you remember but can’t quite place. A memory that only Wayne has heard before.*

**Final Note:**

The room is silent for a beat. The whiskey glass is still. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The intro is done — and it’s the beginning of something.
