**INTRO: "SEARCHLIGHT"**  
*Key: D Minor | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4*  
*Duration: 6 seconds | Feel: Taut, urgent, searching*

---

**BAR 1**  
**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Hi-hat: 8th notes, slightly uneven – like a heartbeat with a glitch.  
- Kick: on 1 and 3  
- Snare: on 2 and 4, but slightly delayed on the 4th beat (like it’s trying to catch up)  
- Cymbal: ghost on 3, barely there, like a whisper.

**BAR 2**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- D2 (MIDI 38) – root  
- F#2 (MIDI 42) – fifth  
- G#2 (MIDI 43) – chromatic approach to A♭2 (chromatic descent to B♭2)  
- A♭2 (MIDI 44) – resolve on the downbeat  
- Walking line: D2 – F#2 – G#2 – A♭2

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Bar 2: Cm7 (C-E♭-G-B♭) – open voicing, left hand on the root and fifth (C-G), right hand with E♭ and B♭  
- Bar 2, beat 2: she pushes the rhythm slightly — her attack is sharp, forward  
- Bar 2, beat 4: she pulls back, lets the silence linger before resolving

**BAR 3**  
**Marcus:**  
- B♭2 (MIDI 46) – root  
- D2 (MIDI 38) – fifth  
- C#2 (MIDI 41) – chromatic approach to D2  
- D2 (MIDI 38) – resolve on beat 3  
- Walking line: B♭2 – D2 – C#2 – D2

**Diane:**  
- Bar 3: F7 (F-A-C-E) – open voicing, left hand on F and C, right hand with A and E  
- She plays it with tension — the E is held just a hair too long, like a breath held

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Bar 3:  
  - D4 (D) – one note, clear, strong  
  - C#4 (C#) – held for half a beat, like a question  
  - Then silence – a full beat of silence  
  - Then B♭4 (B♭) – the answer, but not the one you expect  
  - End on B♭4, holding it just long enough to make you wonder what it means

**BAR 4**  
**Marcus:**  
- G2 (MIDI 43) – root  
- B2 (MIDI 47) – fifth  
- A#2 (MIDI 46) – chromatic approach to B2  
- B2 (MIDI 47) – resolve on beat 4  
- Walking line: G2 – B2 – A#2 – B2

**Diane:**  
- Bar 4: Gm7 (G-B♭-D-F) – open voicing, left hand on G and D, right hand with B♭ and F  
- She plays it with a kind of quiet fury — the B♭ is sharp, the F is held too long  
- Comp on 2 and 4, but the 4th beat is delayed, like a hesitation

**Little Ray:**  
- Hi-hat: same 8th notes, but now they’re slightly stretched, like the music is trying to run faster than it can  
- Snare: on 2 and 4, but the 4th is a ghost  
- Kick: on 1 and 3, but the 3rd is softer, like it’s running out of steam

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Bar 4:  
  - You repeat the motif from Bar 3, but this time you finish it  
  - D4 – C#4 – B♭4 – D4  
  - End on D4, full note, held with a kind of trembling — like you're just holding on  
  - The last note is not a resolution — it’s a question

**Final Note:**  
This intro is not about what is played — it’s about what is *left out*. The silence between the notes, the tension in Marcus’s walking line, the way Diane’s chords refuse to land cleanly. It’s a moment that feels like a ghost in the room — searching, reaching, not quite finding what it’s looking for.

And Wayne Shorter, in the back, leans forward.
