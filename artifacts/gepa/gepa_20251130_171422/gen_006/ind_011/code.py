**Dm Intro – 4 Bars – 160 BPM – Key of Dm – The Cellar, 2am**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3. Snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on every eighth.  
*Subtle, precise, but present. A feeling of anticipation, like the sky before a storm.*  
*Fill: An open hi-hat on beat 3, a ghost note on 4. The tension is building, but he holds back—just enough.*

---

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line in Dm. Chromatic approach to Dm7.  
*Fretboard: D – C – Eb – F – G – Ab – Bb – C – D*  
*He plays it with a soulful, slow push, like he’s telling a story only he knows. The anchor, the heartbeat, the memory.*

---

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp on 2 and 4. 7th chords with dissonance to create tension.*  
*Chords: Dm7 (D-F-A-C) on beat 2, then a G7#9 (G-B-D-F#) on beat 4. Subtle, but sharp.*  
*Her left hand plays a walking line, syncopated, with a little tritone in there. It’s angry, but it’s also listening.*

---

**Bar 2 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*First note: D, held for a full beat. A whisper, but it hangs in the air.*  
*Then, a short phrase: E – Eb – D – C*  
*It’s not a scale. It’s a question. It’s the first time it’s ever been played.*  
*You leave it hanging on the C, open, unresolved, like a door left ajar.*

---

**Bar 3 – Marcus:**  
*Continues the walking line. Chromatic approach to Bb7. A curveball, a twist.*  
*Fretboard: C – Bb – A – Bb – C – D – Eb – F – G*  
*He’s not just walking—he’s leading. He’s guiding the story.*

---

**Bar 3 – Diane:**  
*Comp again. This time, F7#9 on beat 2, then a Bbm7 on beat 4.*  
*Her left hand plays a motive from the saxophone, echoing it with a dissonant twist.*  
*She’s not just comping—she’s responding. She’s listening.*

---

**Bar 3 – You:**  
*You come back in. A little higher. A little more confident.*  
*Play the same motif: E – Eb – D – C, but this time end on the D.*  
*You’re not finishing it. You’re setting it up. You’re making it wait.*

---

**Bar 4 – Little Ray:**  
*Same pattern, but with a subtle fill on beat 3—this time, a snare ghost note and a hihat grace note.*  
*The energy is building. The room is holding its breath.*

---

**Bar 4 – Marcus:**  
*He resolves the chromatic line with a sustained F on beat 4.*  
*A moment of stillness before the storm.*

---

**Bar 4 – Diane:**  
*F7#9 on beat 2, then Bbm7 on beat 4. Dissonant, but not harsh. She’s pushing the tension forward.*  
*Her left hand echoes the saxophone’s motif again, but with a half-step shift. It feels like a memory.*

---

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*You finish the motif. This time, you end it. You close the door.*  
*Final phrase: E – Eb – D – C – D*  
*It’s not a resolution. It’s a beginning.*  
*You leave the last note on the D, sustained, just a breath, just a whisper.*

---

**Wayne Shorter leans forward.**  
He’s not smiling. He’s listening.  
For the first time, the music has existed.  
And you’ve written it.

**End of Intro.**  
Now, the song begins.
