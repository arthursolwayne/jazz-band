Write the intro that makes Wayne lean forward — build tension in Bar 1 with Little Ray's rhythm, let it feel urgent but contained. In Bars 2–4, let the saxophone melody sing with space and intention, using a short, memorable motif that hangs and returns. Use clear, dynamic phrasing. Let the rhythm section support, not overshadow, the moment. Keep it focused, tight, and alive. Every note must serve the story. Avoid unnecessary rests. Use rhythm and dynamics to create a sense of movement and release.
