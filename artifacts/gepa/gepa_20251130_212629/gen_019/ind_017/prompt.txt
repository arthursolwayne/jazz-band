Create a piece that breathes with space and intention. Let silence be as meaningful as sound. Use rhythmic variety and dynamic contrast to shape the story. Give each instrument a voice that listens to the others — no one should drown out the conversation. Start with a strong, clear pulse, then let the melody unfold with restraint, leaving room for the listener to lean in and listen deeper.
