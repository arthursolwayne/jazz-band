---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*No cymbals. Just a kick and snare, but with subtle timing shifts and space.*

- **Kick**: On beat 1 and 3.  
- **Snare**: On beat 2 and 4.  
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth note, but with slight rubato — not perfectly even.  
- **Space**: A quarter note rest on beat 4. Let the silence hang. Make the room listen.

*Think of it like a held breath. The moment before the song begins.*

### **Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line in D minor, starting on D.  
- 16th notes: D – Eb – C – B, then a chromatic run up to F.  
- Chromatic approach on beat 3: D – Eb – F, resolving to G.  
- Avoid repetition. Every note is a question.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- 7th chords, comping on beats 2 and 4.  
- Left hand: Rootless voicings.  
- Right hand:  
  - Beat 2: Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb)  
  - Beat 4: G7 (G, B, D, F)  
- Play with dissonance, but keep the tension moving forward.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick back on beat 1, slight delay on beat 3.  
- Snare on 2 and 4, with a light brush on the snare on beat 4.  
- Hihat: Eighth notes, but with a slight swing in the last eighth of the bar.

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Saxophone)**  
*You enter with the motif. Slow, deliberate, with space between notes.*

- **Phrase**:  
  - Beat 1: D (sustained, soft, with a breathy tone)  
  - Beat 2: Rest  
  - Beat 3: F# (play it like a question, a whisper)  
  - Beat 4: Rest  
- Dynamic: mf to pp  
- Use the breath as punctuation. Let the note hang.  
- Your tone should be like a voice — not just a saxophone.

*This is the moment Wayne listens. You’re not playing a melody — you’re introducing a memory.*

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Saxophone) – Resolution**

- **Phrase**:  
  - Beat 1: Bb (resolve the tension)  
  - Beat 2: Rest  
  - Beat 3: C (a return, but not the same as before)  
  - Beat 4: Rest  
- Play Bb with a slight growl, a bit of grit — like the edge of a blade.  
- End with silence. No sustain. Let the room feel the weight of what just happened.

### **Final Moment:**

The band holds the last note of the bass line (G) just a beat longer than expected. Diane plays a single Bb in the right hand, echoing your line. The room is still. Wayne Shorter sets down his whiskey. He nods. A smile. A nod.

The song hasn’t begun — but it already feels like it’s been waiting for this moment all night.

**That’s the intro.**  
**That’s the breath before the song.**  
**That’s the moment you remember.**
