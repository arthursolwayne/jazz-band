**Key:** D Major  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Duration:** 6 seconds (4 bars at 1.5 seconds per bar)  
**Style:** Modal, introspective, with tension and mystery — a question left hanging, waiting for an answer.

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit:** Kick on beats 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note, but with dynamic contrast — soft on the first two eighths, then a sudden *crash* on the last two.  
**Fill:** At the end of the bar, a ghost note on the snare, just before the bass enters.  
**Purpose:** Create tension, a sense of anticipation.

---

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line**  
**Line (D Major scale, with chromatic approaches):**  
**Beat 1:** D  
**Beat 2:** C# (chromatic approach to D)  
**Beat 3:** E  
**Beat 4:** F# (chromatic approach to G)  
**Rhythm:** Even eighth notes, with a slight emphasis on the "and" of 2 and 4.  
**Purpose:** Anchor the harmony, set the groove, and hint at the key.

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano) – Comping**  
**Chords (7th chords, comp on 2 and 4):**  
- **Beat 1:** D7 (D F# A C#) – open voicing, left hand.  
- **Beat 2:** G7 (G B D F) – right hand, descending.  
- **Beat 3:** D7 – left hand, same as beat 1.  
- **Beat 4:** A7 (A C# E G) – right hand, one note only, held.  
**Purpose:** Color the space, support the melody, but stay out of the way.

---

### **Bar 2 – You (Tenor Sax) – First Phrase**  
**Motif:**  
**Beat 1:** D (low D, on the & of 1)  
**Beat 2:** F# (chromatic up)  
**Beat 3:** E (resolve down)  
**Beat 4:** Open – silence  
**Rhythm:** Quarter note on the "&" of 1, then eighth notes on 2 and 3, ending with a rest.  
**Purpose:** The question — start with a single note, build a small tension, leave it unresolved.

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line (D Major scale with chromatic approaches):**  
**Beat 1:** G  
**Beat 2:** F# (chromatic approach to G)  
**Beat 3:** A  
**Beat 4:** B (chromatic approach to C)  
**Purpose:** Continue the walking line, keep the motion forward.

---

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Chords (7th chords, comp on 2 and 4):**  
- **Beat 1:** D7 (same as before)  
- **Beat 2:** A7 (A C# E G) – right hand, two notes: A and E  
- **Beat 3:** D7  
- **Beat 4:** B7 (B D# F# A) – left hand, one note, B  
**Purpose:** Keep the tension, add a bit of surprise with the B7.

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax) – Second Phrase**  
**Motif (continuation of the question):**  
**Beat 1:** C (low C, on the & of 1)  
**Beat 2:** D (chromatic up)  
**Beat 3:** E (resolve up)  
**Beat 4:** Open – silence  
**Rhythm:** Same as before — quarter note on the "&" of 1, eighth notes on 2 and 3, ending with a rest.  
**Purpose:** The question again. A mirror, but slightly higher — same shape, but with more urgency.

---

### **Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line (D Major scale with chromatic approaches):**  
**Beat 1:** A  
**Beat 2:** B (chromatic approach to C)  
**Beat 3:** D  
**Beat 4:** E (chromatic approach to F#)  
**Purpose:** Continue the motion, build the groove, keep it moving forward.

---

### **Bar 4 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Chords (7th chords, comp on 2 and 4):**  
- **Beat 1:** D7  
- **Beat 2:** B7 (B D# F# A) – right hand, two notes: B and F#  
- **Beat 3:** D7  
- **Beat 4:** D7 (forte, full voicing)  
**Purpose:** Resolve the tension just enough to set up the next phrase — but not completely.

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax) – Resolution (or not)**  
**Motif (finish the question):**  
**Beat 1:** F# (on the & of 1)  
**Beat 2:** E (chromatic down)  
**Beat 3:** D (resolve down)  
**Beat 4:** Open – silence  
**Rhythm:** Same shape. One note, then two, then the resolution.  
**Purpose:** The answer is implied, but not stated. The question lingers — and that’s the point.

---

### **Final Note (to Wayne):**  
You left it open. Not a resolution — a possibility. You didn’t give him an answer, but you gave him a question worth hearing. You made the silence speak.  
He leans forward.  
He nods.  
You’ve earned your moment.
