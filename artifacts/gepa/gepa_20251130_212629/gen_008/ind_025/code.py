### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Kit: Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4, hihat on every eighth. But this time—*  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3, but **light**, like a whisper.  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4, but **dampened**, almost like a sigh.  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth, but **slow and deliberate**, like the ticking of a clock.  
- **Fill:** On the last eighth of bar 1, a **brush stroke**, like a breath held.

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp with 7th chords, but **only on 2 and 4**. Let the silence speak.*  
- **Beat 2:** F7 (F7) – a chromatic approach to Gm7 (the ii chord in Dm key).  
- **Beat 4:** Bb7 (Bb7) – creating tension, a half-step away from Cm7.  
- **Voicings:** Diane plays **voicings that imply movement** but never resolve.  
  - F7: F A C Eb  
  - Bb7: Bb D F Ab  
  - Slight **chromatic movement in the right hand** – maybe a Bb to B, then back to A.  
  - **Space is everything.** No fills, just the chords. Let the tension build.

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, but **chromatic**, with **tension and release**. Let it breathe.*  
- **Notes:**  
  - D (1) → C# (chromatic up)  
  - Bb (2) → B (chromatic up)  
  - A (3) → G# (chromatic up)  
  - G (4) → F# (chromatic up)  
  - **Then a quick release:**  
    - F (1) → E (chromatic down)  
    - D (2) → C# (chromatic down)  
    - C (3) → B (chromatic down)  
    - Bb (4) → A (chromatic down)  
- **Bass line is a question, a path not taken.**

### **Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
*Your moment. One short, simple motif. Let it sing.*  
**Phrase:**  
- **Start on Bb**, a half-step above Dm7.  
- Play **Bb – C – Bb – C** – a **rising and falling** motion, almost a question.  
- Let it **hang on the last note (C)** for a full beat.  
- **No runs**, no scale work – just **two notes with meaning**.  
- The phrase is **simple but full**, like a memory you can’t quite place.  
- Let the **space after the note** be felt. That’s where the story begins.

**Final Feel:**  
It’s not a melody yet — it’s a **question in the air**, a **door left ajar**, waiting for the rest of the story to unfold.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He **knows**.  

This is the intro that makes the room hold its breath.
