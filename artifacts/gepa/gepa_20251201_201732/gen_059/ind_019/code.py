**INTRO – "Echoes in the Cellar"**  
**Key: D Minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM, 4/4 Time**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

**BAR 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- **Kick**: 1, 3  
- **Snare**: 2, 4  
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth note (closed, crisp, tight)  
- **Fill**: A short, open-ended *ride cymbal swells* on the last eighth of the bar — like a whisper, like a door creaking open.

---

**BAR 2: Marcus (Bass)**  
- **Roots & Fifths with Chromatic Approaches**  
  - D2 (D) → F2 (F)  
  - C2 (C) → D2 (D)  
  - A2 (A) → Bb2 (Bb)  
  - G2 (G) → A2 (A)  
  - *Walking line: D2 – F2 – C2 – D2 – A2 – Bb2 – G2 – A2*  
  - *MIDI: 38 – 43 – 36 – 38 – 41 – 42 – 43 – 41*  
  - The bass holds the pulse, but leans into tension — like a question in the dark.

---

**BAR 2: Diane (Piano)**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4**  
  - **Bar 2, beat 2**: Open voicing, *Fmaj7* (F, A, C, E)  
  - **Bar 2, beat 4**: Open voicing, *Gm7* (G, Bb, D, F)  
  - *She plays only the two beats, but the chords are dissonant and unresolved — like a memory she can't quite place.*

---

**BAR 3: Marcus (Bass)**  
- *Same walking line, but slightly faster, more urgent*  
  - *D2 – F2 – C2 – D2 – A2 – Bb2 – G2 – A2*  
  - *Now with a little more push, like the answer is coming but not yet.*

---

**BAR 3: Diane (Piano)**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4**  
  - **Bar 3, beat 2**: Open voicing, *Am7* (A, C, E, G)  
  - **Bar 3, beat 4**: Open voicing, *Bb7* (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
  - *She’s building tension — the key is shifting, but not yet. She’s probing.*

---

**BAR 4: You (Sax)**  
- **Motif: One phrase, four notes, suspended**  
  - **Bar 4, beat 1**: F# (D minor scale, 4th degree)  
  - **Bar 4, beat 2**: D (root)  
  - **Bar 4, beat 3**: Rest  
  - **Bar 4, beat 4**: Bb (chromatic approach to A)  
- *Let it hang. Don’t resolve. Make it feel like the question is still out there. The air is thick. The room is holding its breath.*

---

**Final Note (Bar 4, beat 4): Bb**  
- *You don’t play the A, you don’t play the G. You leave it open. The silence is part of the story.*

---

**Wayne Shorter leans forward.**  
He's heard a lot in his time. But this — this is something new. A question in D minor. A saxophone that doesn't run but searches. A quartet that doesn't play to please but to ask.

The intro ends — but the story has just begun.
