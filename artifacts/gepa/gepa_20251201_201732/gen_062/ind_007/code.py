### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*No bass, no piano, no sax. Just the sound of a heartbeat.*  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3 (F2 and F2), soft, rhythmic, like a breath.
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4 (F3 and F3), crisp, but not sharp.
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (16th grid). Subtle, muted, like rain on a tin can.
- **Feel:** Suspense. Waiting. The room holds its breath.

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano) Enters**  
*Open voicings. Tension and release. Anger in the chords.*  
- **Beat 1:** **Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D♭)** – open, dissonant, unresolved.  
- **Beat 2:** **Db7 (Db, F, Ab, C)** – a bit of a twist, like a memory.  
- **Beat 3:** **Fm7** again – back to the start, but with more weight.  
- **Beat 4:** **C7 (C, E, G, Bb)** – tension to resolution.  
- **Style:** Her fingers hit the keys like she’s writing a letter she never wants to send.

### **Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax) Enters**  
*Your moment. One short motif. Make it sing.*  
- **Melody:**  
  - **Beat 1:** F (F4) – a whisper, like the first breath of a storm.  
  - **Beat 2:** Ab (Ab4) – a question, a pause.  
  - **Beat 3:** **(Rest)** – silence. The space between notes.  
  - **Beat 4:** F (F4) again – a return, but not the same.  
- **Phrasing:** Play the first note, leave it hanging. Then return on the final beat.  
- **Sound:** Warm, dark, but not sad. Like a memory that lingers.

**END OF INTRO.**  
The room is still. The whiskey in Wayne’s glass stops mid-sip.  
He leans forward.  
He’s heard something new.  
Something that wasn’t written in the books.  
Something that came from the dark.
