**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Style: Modern jazz, with a touch of avant-garde**

**Bar 1 (0:00–0:1.5s): Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Set the mood — tension, anticipation.*  
- Kick on beats 1 and 3, but with a slight delay on beat 3, as if holding back.  
- Snare on 2 and 4, but softer on 2, like a breath before the storm.  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note, but with a ghost note on beat 3, creating a space that *feels* like a question.  
- *Let the silence between the hihat hits linger. Make it feel like the room is holding its breath.*

**Bar 2 (0:1.5–0:3s): Diane (Piano) – Comping with 7th chords**  
*She enters with F7 (F, A, C, Eb), but with a chromatic approach to the 3rd (A to Ab to A).*  
- She plays the chord on beat 2, then a quick, dissonant passing tone on beat 3 (Ab).  
- On beat 4, she resolves to the 7th chord again (F7), but with a diminished passing chord on the "and" of 3 (Bb7♭5).  
- *She’s not following — she’s questioning. The chords are sharp, but they don’t answer. They provoke.*

**Bar 3 (0:3–0:4.5s): Marcus (Bass) – Walking line, chromatic, no repetition**  
*He starts with a chromatic line descending from E♭ to D to C to B♭, then a half-step up to B, then a chromatic run down to A, then a half-step up to A♯.*  
- It’s not a standard walking line — it’s a narrative. Each note is a step toward something unresolved.  
- *He’s the anchor, but he’s also the map. He’s leading the way, but not telling you where.*

**Bar 4 (0:4.5–0:6s): Dante (Tenor Sax) – Melody – The Answer that Isn’t**  
*You start with a short motif — two notes, no resolution.*

- **Bar 4, Beat 1:** F (tenor) — a strong, open note.  
- **Beat 2:** G♭ — a half-step up, chromatic, like a question.  
- **Beat 3:** F — return to the tonic, but with a slight rubato, a pause.  
- **Beat 4:** G♭ — again, but this time, you don't play the next note. You leave it hanging.  
- *You end the intro with a question. A phrase that wants to be answered — but doesn’t demand it.*

**Final Note:**  
You hold the G♭ for a fraction longer than the beat, and then you stop. Silence. Not empty, but full of intent. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The room holds its breath. The story has begun.

Now, the music can go anywhere. But for now — just four bars. Just one question.
