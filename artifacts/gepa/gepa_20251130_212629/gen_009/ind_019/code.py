**Title: "Door of the Cellar"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  
**Mood: Mysterious, unresolved, inviting**

---

**BAR 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4, hihat on every eighth.*  
A slow, deliberate build — the heartbeat of the club, the echo of a memory.  
- **Kick**: 1, 3  
- **Snare**: 2, 4  
- **Hi-Hats**: 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & (steady, soft, like a breath)  
Begin with a slight fill on the “& of 4”, a whisper before the storm.

---

**BAR 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
*Walking line, chromatic approach to F7, no repeated notes.*  
Start on **F**, walk up to **A**, then **B♭**, **B**, **C**, **D**, **E♭**, **E**, **F** — a chromatic line that resolves to a **F7** on beat 4.  
- **Bar 2**: F, G♭, G, A, B♭, B, C, D, E♭, E, F  
- Chromatic line that feels like a question — searching, unresolved.

---

**BAR 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
*Comp on 2 and 4, with 7th chords, tension in the left hand.*  
On **beat 2**, play **F7** (F, A, C, E♭), then on **beat 4**, **Fm7** (F, A♭, C, E♭).  
- Left hand: Play **F, G♭, F, G♭** on beats 2 and 4 (tense, dissonant).  
- Right hand: Comp with a rhythmic, angular approach — not too busy, but with tension.

---

**BAR 3 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Same pattern, but a bit more energy.*  
Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4, hihat on every eighth.  
- Add a light ride cymbal on the “& of 2” and “& of 4” — subtle, but adding space.  
- Let the energy breathe — don’t fill the bar, just push it forward.

---

**BAR 3 – Marcus (Bass)**  
*Continue the walking line, now resolving slightly.*  
- This bar: C, D, E♭, E, F, G, G♭, F  
A stepwise motion that feels like a return, but not quite home.

---

**BAR 3 – Diane (Piano)**  
*Comp with **Fm7** on beat 2, tension in the left hand.*  
- Left hand: F, G♭, E♭, D  
- Right hand: Play a **F diminished 7** (F, A♭, C♭, E♭) on the “& of 2” — a color that adds mystery.

---

**BAR 4 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Same pattern, but now with a slight swell — the moment before the melody.*  
Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4, hihat on every eighth.  
- Add a soft cymbal on the “& of 4” — a final breath before the music begins.

---

**BAR 4 – Marcus (Bass)**  
*Chromatic line again, but this time ends on a **C** — the first note of your motif.*  
- **Bar 4**: F, G, G♯, A, B♭, B, C  
Ends on **C**, a strong, open note — the threshold of your melody.

---

**BAR 4 – Diane (Piano)**  
*Comp with **Cm7** on beat 2, left hand with **C, B, A, G** — descending, unresolved.*  
- Right hand: **C, E♭, G, B♭** — a **Cm7** chord, played with space and tension.

---

**BAR 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
*Your motif: one phrase, open-ended, with space between notes.*  
- **Phrase**: C (beat 1), rest (beat 2), C (beat 3), rest (beat 4)  
But played with **space, breath, intention** — the note is long, lingering, like a voice in the dark saying,  
*"I'm here. Can you hear me?"*  
Let the note hang in the air — that’s the moment Wayne leans forward.

**End of Intro.**  
The room holds its breath. The door is open.  
And now, the music begins.
