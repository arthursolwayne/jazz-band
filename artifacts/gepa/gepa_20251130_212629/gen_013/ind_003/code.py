**Title: "Question in the Dark"**  
**Key: D minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  
**Mood: Suspense, yearning, anticipation**  

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 & 3  
**Snare:** On 2 & 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Fill:** A subtle brush stroke on the "3" of the bar, barely there, like a breath before the storm.

---

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Walking line in D minor:**  
**D – Eb – F – G** (chromatic approach to G)  
**G – Ab – Bb – B** (chromatic approach to B)  
**B – C – D – Eb** (chromatic approach to Eb)  
**Eb – E – F – G** (chromatic approach to G)

Each note is a step in the dark, precise, never repeating, guiding through the unknown.

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Comping on 2 & 4 with 7th chords:**  
**Bar 2, beat 2:** Dm7 (D – F – A – C)  
**Bar 2, beat 4:** G7 (G – B – D – F)  
Each chord is a color — deep, unresolved, full of tension.

---

### **Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
Same pattern as bar 1, but with a little more energy. The energy is building.

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Walking line in D minor:**  
**G – A – Bb – B** (chromatic approach to B)  
**B – C – D – Eb** (chromatic approach to Eb)  
**Eb – E – F – G** (chromatic approach to G)  
**G – Ab – Bb – B** (chromatic approach to B)

Still walking, still never repeating a note.

---

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Comping on 2 & 4 with 7th chords:**  
**Bar 3, beat 2:** Cm7 (C – Eb – G – Bb)  
**Bar 3, beat 4:** F7 (F – A – C – Eb)  
Still moving, still unresolved, still pushing.

---

### **Bar 3 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
Same energy, same rhythm — but now it feels like the room is holding its breath.

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif:**

**Bar 4, beat 1:** D (long, open, with a little vibrato)  
**Bar 4, beat 2:** F (half-step above D, tension)  
**Bar 4, beat 3:** Bb (a half-step below B, almost a B natural, but not quite)  
**Bar 4, beat 4:** Rest  

That’s it.  
One phrase.  
A question.  
You leave it hanging.  
The room holds.  
Wayne leans forward.  
The story begins.

---

**Final Note:**  
The space after the rest is where the real music lives.  
You don’t play scales. You play intention.  
You let the silence speak.  
And you wait —  
For the answer.
