**Improved Prompt:**

You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait. Use dynamic variation and rhythmic contrast. Let the hihat breathe, and make the kick and snare feel like a question. Avoid mechanical repetition — make the rhythm feel alive, almost uncertain.

Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before. Use space and tension. Let the saxophone motif feel incomplete at first, then resolve it. Avoid predictable patterns. Use rests and unexpected rhythms to create emotional depth. Make the music feel like a story beginning — not just a setup.

For the drums in Bar 1: Use the kick and snare to frame the question, but let the hi-hat build a sense of anticipation. Vary dynamics — don’t just hit the same volume each time. Let the rhythm breathe.

For the bass: Marcus is the anchor. Give him a walking line with chromatic approaches. Never repeat the same note twice. Keep it moving, but make it feel like he’s listening for something.

For the piano: Diane is angry. Use 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving. Let her chords create tension but not resolution.

For the sax: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit. Let the melody feel like a whisper that wants to be heard, not a statement that wants to be proved.

You have 6 seconds. One key. No modulation. No pressure. But this is your moment. Make it count.
