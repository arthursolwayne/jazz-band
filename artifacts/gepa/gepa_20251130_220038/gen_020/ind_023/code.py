**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 6.0 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Setup. The silence before the storm.*  
- Kick on **1** and **3**  
- Snare on **2** and **4**  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note  
- **Fill:** At the end of the bar, a quick triplet on the snare, just before the beat, to create tension.  
- **Space:** No cymbal crash. Just the click of the snare, the hihat, the breath of the room.  
- *Let the audience lean in.*

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters:**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **F – G – Ab – Bb** (chromatic approach to Bb)  
- **Bb – C – D – Eb** (chromatic approach to Eb)  
- **Eb – F – G – Ab** (chromatic approach to Ab)  
- **Ab – Bb – C – D** (chromatic approach to D)  
- *Walking line, never repeating a note. Each note is a question.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - **2:** F7 (F A C Eb)  
  - **4:** Bb7 (Bb D F Ab)  
- *Sparse, deliberate. Dissonant chords to highlight the space around the melody.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on **1** and **3**  
- Snare on **2** and **4**  
- Hi-hat on every eighth  
- **Fill:** Mid-bar, a quick brush on the snare, just before the melody enters.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Melody (Bar 2):**  
  - **F – G – Ab – Bb** (chromatic line, ascending)  
  - *Play it clean, with a little breath between the notes. Let it hang in the air.*

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Melody:**  
  - **Bb – C – D – Eb**  
  - *Same intervallic shape as before, but starting on Bb. A mirror image. Let the silence between G and Bb speak.*  
  - *Pause on the G. Let the bass and piano support the silence. Let the space mean something.*

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Melody:**  
  - **Eb – F – G – Ab**  
  - *The same motif, now in a new key. A journey. A memory walking through the door.*  
  - *End on the Ab, not resolving. Leave it open. Let the room hold the question.*

---

### **Final Note:**

- Diane resolves the tension with a **D7** on beat 4.  
- Marcus walks in with **Ab – Bb – C – D**  
- Little Ray plays a final snare hit on the "and" of 4, like the last heartbeat of the intro.

**The air is still.**  
You let it hang.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
It’s yours.
