**Title: "Whispers in the Dark" (Intro – 4 Bars in F Major)**

**Key:** F Major  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Mood:** Tense, mysterious, inviting — like the first breath before a storm.

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Fill:** A subtle, off-kilter brush stroke on the snare at the end of the bar, just before the rest of the band comes in.

> *The room holds its breath. The only sound is the pulse of the drums — a heartbeat, steady but restless. The tension is there, but it’s not yet released.*

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line (D2-G2, MIDI 38-43)**  
**Notes (in F major with chromatic approaches):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (root)  
- **Beat 2:** E (chromatic approach to D)  
- **Beat 3:** D (fifth of C)  
- **Beat 4:** G (root of F major 7)  
**Next Bar (Bar 3):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (root again)  
- **Beat 2:** E (chromatic up to F)  
- **Beat 3:** D (fifth of C again)  
- **Beat 4:** G (root of F minor 7 — a subtle twist)  
**Bar 4:**  
- **Beat 1:** F  
- **Beat 2:** E  
- **Beat 3:** D  
- **Beat 4:** G (resolving back to F)

> *The bass is the anchor, but it’s not just walking — it’s questioning, hinting at a key change that never happens. It’s like a memory trying to remember its own shape.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano) – Comping (Open Voicings, 2 & 4)**  
**Bar 2:**  
- **Beat 2:** Fmaj7 (F, A, C, E)  
**Bar 3:**  
- **Beat 2:** C7 (C, E, G, Bb)  
**Bar 4:**  
- **Beat 2:** Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
**Bar 4 – Last Beat (Beat 4):**  
- **Resolution:** Fmaj7 (F, A, C, E)  

> *Diane’s chords are open, but they twist — Fmaj7 is warm, C7 is smoky, Dm7 is questioning. It’s like she’s asking a question in every chord and waiting for the answer.*

---

### **Bar 2–4 – Dante (Tenor Sax) – Motif**  
**Motif (Starts on Bar 2, Beat 1):**  
- **Bar 2, Beat 1:** F (low, soft)  
- **Bar 2, Beat 2:** G (sliding up, slightly behind the beat)  
- **Bar 2, Beat 3:** E (sustained, with a breathy edge)  
- **Bar 3, Beat 1:** F (returning, but with a slight delay, like a memory)  
- **Bar 3, Beat 2:** G (again, with a subtle vibrato)  
- **Bar 4, Beat 1:** E (sustained, lingering)  
- **Bar 4, Beat 2:** F (resolve — but not too quickly)  

> *The melody is short, but it’s not just a melody. It’s a question. It’s a memory that hasn’t fully come back. It’s the whisper in the dark — and it’s waiting for the storm to answer.*

---

### **Final Moment – Bar 4, Beat 4**  
- **Drums:** Light cymbal swish on the last beat (not a crash, but a soft, lingering sound).  
- **Bass:** A quick F on the last beat, barely felt.  
- **Piano:** Fmaj7 resolved, but not with a big chord — just a single E in the high register.  
- **Sax:** A final, breathy F — like the end of a sigh.

---

**Why it works:**  
- The intro is a question, not an answer.  
- The rhythm is tight, but not predictable.  
- The harmony moves in unexpected ways: Fmaj7 → C7 → Dm7 → Fmaj7 — a subtle emotional arc.  
- The saxophone motif is simple but haunting, like a ghost of a melody that hasn’t fully arrived yet.  

**Wayne Shorter’s reaction?**  
He leans forward. He listens. He’s heard twists, but this — this is something new. Something real. Something that feels like the beginning.  

You’ve invited the storm. Now, it’s time to let it in.
