**Dante Russo – 4-Bar Intro in Fm (160 BPM, 4/4 Time)**  
*For Wayne Shorter. At The Cellar. 2am. No pressure. Just a question. Just a whisper. Just a story.*

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** 1 & 3  
**Snare:** 2 & 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note, but *soft*, with a slight fade on the 4th beat.  
**Fill:** A half-note hihat on beat 3, then a small, delicate snare ghost on the "and" of 4.  
*Let the silence speak. The question is in the space between the hits.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Everyone Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Fm7 (F Ab C Eb) walking line, starting on F.  
- Chromatic approach to Ab on the "and" of 2 (G#), and to C on the "and" of 4 (B).  
- Keep it smooth, never repeating the same note.  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on 2 and 4.  
- F7 (F A C Eb) on beat 2, then Bb7 (Bb D F Ab) on beat 4.  
- Use the upper register, sparse, but with tension.  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4.  
- Hi-hat on every eighth, but a slight *swell* on beat 1 and a *drop* on beat 3.  
- Add a choked snare on the "and" of 4 for a subtle release.  

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- Start with a long, sustained F on beat 1.  
- Then a small, mysterious phrase:  
  **F – Ab – C – (rest)**  
  *Let it hang. Let the silence build. Let it feel like a memory walking through the door.*

### **Bar 3 – Dante continues the motif**  
**Marcus:**  
- Fm7 walking again, now moving toward Bb.  
- Chromatic approach to Bb on the "and" of 2 (A#).  

**Diane:**  
- Comp on 2 and 4.  
- This time: Bb7 on beat 2, then Eb7 on beat 4.  
- Add a dissonant chord on the "and" of 3: C7 (C E G B).  

**Little Ray:**  
- Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4.  
- Hi-hat is louder now, but still controlled.  
- A small cymbal splash just before beat 4.  

**Dante:**  
- Resume the motif:  
  **Bb – Eb – (rest) – (rest)**  
  *Now the melody is incomplete. It lingers. It aches. It hints at something more.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Resolution and Echo**  
**Marcus:**  
- Bb7 walking, chromatic approach to Eb on the "and" of 2 (D#).  
- Ends on a sustained Eb.  

**Diane:**  
- Comp on 2 and 4.  
- Eb7 on beat 2, Fm7 on beat 4.  
- Use a high, ringing F in the upper register on beat 4.  

**Little Ray:**  
- Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4.  
- Hi-hat is now *very soft*, almost like a whisper.  
- A half-note hihat on beat 4, then a soft cymbal fade.  

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- Finish the motif:  
  **Eb – F – (rest)**  
  *The melody ends with an open F, sustained just a little too long. It lingers in the air. It doesn’t resolve. It waits. It speaks. It *is* the question.*

### **Final Note**  
The room holds its breath.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
The story is told.  
It’s not about the answer.  
It’s about what happens after the question.  

*That’s the thing about jazz.*
