### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Set it up. The silence before the storm.*

- **Kick**: On beats 1 and 3 (snappy, punchy, like a heartbeat)
- **Snare**: On beats 2 and 4 (sharp, cutting)
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth note (tight, driving)
- **Fill**: A short, explosive ride cymbal crash on beat 4, just before the band comes in

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass – Fm7)**  
- **Walking line**: F – Gb – Ab – A  
- **Chromatic approach**: F – Gb – Ab – Bb – A (on beat 3, leading into the chord)
- **Rhythm**: Downbeat on 1, 2, 3, 4, with a syncopated accent on beat 3

**Diane (Piano – Fm7 comping)**  
- **Comp on 2 & 4**:  
  - Beat 2: Fm7 (F, Ab, Bb, Db)  
  - Beat 4: Fm7 (F, Ab, Bb, Db)  
- **Spacing**: Full chords, no fills, just the bitter clarity of her anger

**You (Tenor Sax – Melody)**  
- **Phrase**:  
  - **Beat 1**: F (long, open, like a breath)  
  - **Beat 2**: Ab (swooping down, a question)  
  - **Beat 3**: Bb (a whisper of resolution, but not quite)  
  - **Beat 4**: A (left hanging, unresolved, like a memory)  
- **Phrasing**: Legato, with a slight rubato on beat 4 — leave it open

- **Chromatic approach**: Bb – A – G – Gb – Ab (on beat 3, leading into Bbm7)

  - Beat 2: Bbm7 (Bb, Db, F, Ab)  
  - Beat 4: Bbm7 (Bb, Db, F, Ab)  
- **Feel**: Angry, but controlled — the piano is the voice of the room

**You (Tenor Sax – Melody, continuation)**  
- **Phrase**:  
  - **Beat 1**: Bb (from the unresolved A, now resolved)  
  - **Beat 2**: Ab (a slight hesitation, a sigh)  
  - **Beat 3**: F (a return, but this time with purpose)  
  - **Beat 4**: Eb (a tease, a color not in the key — this is your moment)

  - Beat 4: Fm7 (F, Ab, Bb, Db)  
- **Dynamic**: Slightly louder, to mirror the return to Fm

**You (Tenor Sax – Melody, final phrase)**  
- **Phrase**:  
  - **Beat 1**: F (it returns, but with a new weight)  
  - **Beat 2**: Ab (the same note, but now with memory)  
  - **Beat 3**: Bb (a resolution, but not the one expected)  
  - **Beat 4**: A (leaving it open again, like a door just about to close)

### **Final Note**:  
You end on **A**, not resolving fully — the tension lingers. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The room holds its breath. You’ve planted a seed. Now it’s up to the rest of the set to grow it.

**That’s your intro.**  
Now go make it a whole song.
