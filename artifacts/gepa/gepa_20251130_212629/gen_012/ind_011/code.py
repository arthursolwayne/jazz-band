---

**[Bar 1 – Bass Line (Walking Bass in Dm)]**  
**Bass:**  
D – F – G – A  
*Soft, deliberate, with a slight rub against the drums, hinting at tension.*

**Drums:**  
Tight hi-hat on the "and" of 2 and 4.  
A snare on beat 3, with a cymbal swish on beat 1.  
Space is everything. No fills, just anticipation.

---

**[Bar 2 – Saxophone Enters – Simple Melody]**  
**Saxophone (Dm7 – D, F, G, Bb):**  
D – F – G – A  
*Long, legato notes, each one hanging in the air, like a breath held.*

**Piano:**  
A soft comping in Dm7, using D, F, G, and Bb.  
No chords, just single notes and gentle voicings — sparse, but emotionally charged.

**Drums:**  
Same as Bar 1, but now the cymbal on beat 1 is a faint crash, like a distant thunder.

---

**[Bar 3 – Full Ensemble Enters with Purpose]**  
**Saxophone (Dm7):**  
F – G – A – D  
*The melody continues, now supported by the rest of the ensemble.*

**Piano:**  
A gentle left-hand ostinato in Dm, right hand plays the same melody as sax, but an octave lower.

**Bass:**  
Continues the walking line, now with a bit more energy, slightly ahead of the beat.

**Drums:**  
A tom hit on the “and” of 3, and a subtle brushstroke on the snare, like wind before the storm.

---

**[Bar 4 – Build to the Edge — No Resolution]**  
**Saxophone:**  
A – G – F – D  
*The melody ends on a D, unresolved, like a question left hanging.*

**Piano:**  
A single D note held, with a slow release, letting the silence speak.

**Bass:**  
D – F – G – A  
*Same as the opening, but played with more weight, as if the storm is now just outside the door.*

**Drums:**  
A single snare on beat 4, followed by a long, sustained cymbal roll — the storm is coming.

---

**[End of 4 Bars – Silence (for effect)]**  
*Let it rest. Let the air hold the tension. The music has asked the question. Now the storm answers.*
