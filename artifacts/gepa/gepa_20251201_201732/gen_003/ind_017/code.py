**Title: "Whispers in the Cellar"**  
**Key: Fm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Length: 4 bars (6 seconds total)**  

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick on 1 and 3**, **snare on 2 and 4**, **hihat on every eighth**.  
But here’s the trick: **no hihat on the second half of the bar**.  
**Bar 1** is a **half-time feel** — the hihat stops on 3 and 4.  
This creates tension, a **lurking energy** — like the room holds its breath.  
**Fill on beat 4**: a **brushed cymbal roll** that fades into silence.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble In**  

#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
Starts with a **chromatically approached root** (Fm = F, Ab, C).  
**MIDI:**  
- Beat 1: **Ab (MIDI 43)**  
- Beat 2: **F (MIDI 38)**  
- Beat 3: **G (MIDI 42)** — chromatic approach  
- Beat 4: **C (MIDI 40)**

**Voicing:** Root and fifth with chromatic approach. Anchor, but with a twist.

#### **Diane (Piano)**  
**Bar 2: Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)**  
**Open voicing:** F, Ab, C, D — spread out high to low.  
**Resolution on beat 4** with a **chromatic approach** to the 3rd (C → D).

#### **You (Tenor Sax)**  
Start the motif — a **three-note phrase** with **rhythmic variation** and **space**.

**Phrase:**  
- **Beat 1**: Long note on **Ab** (first note of Fm) — **quarter note**  
- **Beat 2**: **C** — **eighth note**  
- **Beat 3**: Rest  
- **Beat 4**: **Eb** — **eighth note**, held into the next bar

This is the **question**. It doesn’t resolve. It leaves you hanging.  
**Ab – C – (rest) – Eb**, then silence.  
A whisper, not a shout.

---

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble**  

#### **Marcus**  
Same rhythm as Bar 2, but now **Ab (MIDI 43)** on beat 1, **C (MIDI 40)** on beat 2, **Bb (MIDI 39)** on beat 3, **F (MIDI 38)** on beat 4.  
Still walking, still chromatic, but now the **chromatic approach is descending**.

#### **Diane**  
Bar 3: **Bbmaj7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)**  
**Open voicing**: Bb, D, F, Ab  
**Resolution on beat 4** to the **Ab** again — a **tension to the b7**.

#### **You (Tenor Sax)**  
Now **answer** the question.  
**Beat 1**: **Bb** — **half note**  
**Beat 2**: **D** — **eighth note**  
**Beat 3**: **Eb** — **eighth note**  
**Beat 4**: **C** — **eighth note**, held into the next bar

This is the **counter-question**.  
You start with the **b7** (Bb), set up the **D** (9), then return to the **Eb**, the same note from Bar 2 — now **answered** with a **C**, the **root** of the next chord.

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble**  

#### **Marcus**  
**Beat 1**: **F (MIDI 38)**  
**Beat 2**: **Ab (MIDI 43)**  
**Beat 3**: **G (MIDI 42)** — chromatic approach again  
**Beat 4**: **C (MIDI 40)**

#### **Diane**  
Bar 4: **Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)** again — but this time, **resolve the tension** by **holding the D** on beat 4, not resolving down to C.

#### **You (Tenor Sax)**  
Now, **finish the motif**.  
**Beat 1**: **F** — **quarter note** (root of the key)  
**Beat 2**: **Ab** — **eighth note**  
**Beat 3**: **C** — **eighth note**  
**Beat 4**: rest

So the full motif is:  
**Ab – C – (rest) – Eb**  
**Bb – D – Eb – C**  
**F – Ab – C – (rest)**

It’s a **loop that doesn’t close**, but **hinted at a resolution**.

---

### **Final Silence**  
After the final note, **no coda**.  
Let the **room breathe**.  
Let the **silence speak**.  
Let **Wayne** lean forward.  
Let him hear **something new**.

**That’s your intro.**  
**That’s the story.**  
**That’s the whisper.**
