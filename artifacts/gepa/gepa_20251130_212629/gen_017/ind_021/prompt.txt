Create an intro that feels like a whisper before a storm, with tension and release. The drums should build anticipation, then the ensemble enters with clarity and purpose. The saxophone melody should be simple but emotionally charged — something that lingers in the air. Every note should feel intentional, every rest meaningful. No unnecessary repetition. Keep the rhythm tight, the harmony honest, and the space between the notes alive. The saxophone motif should begin with a clear, singular idea, leave it hanging, and return to complete it — not as a run, but as a phrase that breathes. The bass should walk with chromatic tension, never repeating a note, and the piano should comp with 7th chords, staying out of the way but keeping the momentum. The drums should fill every bar with rhythmic energy, but never drown out the space. This is your moment — make it feel like the first time.
