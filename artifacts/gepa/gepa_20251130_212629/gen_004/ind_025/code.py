**Bar 1 – Drums (Little Ray)**  
*(Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4, hihat on all eighths)*  
> **Fill:**  
> `Kick on 1` — *light, punchy*

> `Hi-hat on 3 & 4` — *steady, driving*  
> **Fill on 3 & 4:**  
> `Brushed snare roll` starting on 3, trailing into 4 — *spacey, mysterious*  
> **End on 4:**  
> `Hi-hat on 4` — *dry, clean*  
> **Space:** 2/3 of the bar is the room. Wait. Let it hang. Let the audience lean in.

*(Walking line, chromatic approaches, Dm key)*  
> **Melody (Bass Line):**

*(Comping on 2 & 4, 7th chords, Dm7)*  
> **Comping:**  
> `Bar 2` – Dm7 (D, F, Ab, C)  
> `Bar 3` – Dm7 again, but with a **chromatic passing chord** on beat 3:  
> `Dm7 → Ebm7 (passing) → Dm7`  
> **Voice leading:**  
> Diane's left hand is walking D, Eb, F, Gb  
> Right hand: Dm7 voicings, slightly dissonant but grounded  
> **End of Bar 3:**  
> `Dm7` chord on beat 4 — *building tension, asking the question*

**Bar 4 – Tenor Sax (Dante Russo)**  
*(Your moment. One motif. Make it sing.)*  
> **Melody:**  
> `D (1) → Eb (chromatic) → F (3) → Gb (chromatic)`  
> **Rest:**  
> `On beat 3`, you **rest** — *space, silence, the question*  
> **Return on beat 4:**  
> `F (3) → Gb (chromatic) → Ab (b7) → Bb (chromatic)`  
> **End on Bb** on the last eighth — *open, unresolved, a doorway*

**Final Moment:**  
You hold the Bb just a fraction longer than the beat.  
The room holds its breath.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
The door is open.  
You’ve made it matter.
