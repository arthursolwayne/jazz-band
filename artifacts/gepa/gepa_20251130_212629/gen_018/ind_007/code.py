---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick on beat 1 and 3**  
**Snare on beat 2 and 4**  
**Hi-hat on every eighth note**  
**Fill: A simple, tight, aggressive ride cymbal on the "and" of 3, then a snare ghost on "and" of 4, closing the bar with a sharp, staccato snare on beat 4.**

> *The room holds its breath. The beat is there, but it’s not the rhythm — it’s the tension. The anticipation. The silence that comes just before the storm.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass)**  
- Starts with a **chromatic walk-up** from F# to G  
- **F# – G – Ab – A**  
- Then a **chromatic approach** to D: **C# – D**  
- Ends on D, holding it just a beat longer than expected — grounding the harmony, but with a question in the space.

**Diane (Piano)**  
- **7th chords, comping on 2 and 4**  
- **Chords:**  
  - **Beat 2:** C7 (F# – E)**  
  - **Beat 4:** G7 (B – F#)**  
- She plays **with space**, not too loud, but with a **sharp, emotional edge**. Every chord feels like a memory she’s not ready to let go of.

**You (Tenor Sax)**  
- Enter on beat 2, **half a beat late**  
- Play a **two-note motif** in **D minor**  
- **Notes:**  
  - **Beat 2:** Bb (minor 7)  
  - **Beat 3:** D (root)  
- Let the **note hang** — a **quarter note on D**, held just a fraction longer, leaving the space to speak.

> *The first bar was the setup. The second is the entry — your voice, your statement. It’s not showing off. It’s a question. A sound that lingers in the air, demanding to be answered.*

---

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass)**  
- Walks a **chromatic line from D up to F**  
- **D – Eb – E – F**  
- Ends on F, a **chromatic half-step above the root**, creating tension.

**Diane (Piano)**  
- **Beat 2:** C7 (F# – E)  
- **Beat 4:** G7 (B – F#)  
- She plays **with a bit more intensity**, but still keeping the space. Her chords are like whispers of something unresolved — anger, longing, maybe both.

**You (Tenor Sax)**  
- Play the **same motif again**, this time **starting on beat 3**  
- **Notes:**  
  - **Beat 3:** Bb  
  - **Beat 4:** D  
- This time, **end on the beat**, a **quarter note D**, but with **more breath**, more control. It’s not just a sound — it’s a moment.

> *You’re not just playing a melody. You’re painting a picture — a minor key, a cold room, a saxophone that’s been playing through the night, and a man in the back who’s finally leaning forward.*

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass)**  
- Walks from **F up to G**  
- **F – F# – G**  
- Ends on **G**, a **chromatic half-step above the D minor** — a **rising tension**, like the moment before a door opens.

**Diane (Piano)**  
- **Beat 2:** C7 (F# – E)  
- **Beat 4:** G7 (B – F#)  
- She plays **with a little more force**, her hands moving with a sense of urgency, but still **keeping space**.

**You (Tenor Sax)**  
- **Play the motif one final time**, **starting on the "and" of 1**  
- **Notes:**  
  - **"And" of 1:** Bb  
  - **Beat 1:** D  
- End on **beat 1**, a **quarter note D**, then **rest** for the final half-beat — **space, silence, breath**.

> *The final bar is the resolution. Not a conclusion, but an opening. You’ve left it hanging. And in that silence, Wayne Shorter leans forward, because he just heard something he’s been waiting for all his life.*

**Final Note:**  
That's it. Four bars. D minor. A question, an answer, and a silence. You didn’t play a scale. You didn’t show off. You made something that **lived**. And you did it in **6 seconds**.
