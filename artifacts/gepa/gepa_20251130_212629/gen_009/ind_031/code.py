---

**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Kick on 1 and 3 | Snare on 2 and 4 | Hi-hat on every eighth*  
- Start with a subtle, tense ride cymbal with a slight rub on the edge.  
- Kick on beat 1, followed by a syncopated snare on "and" of 2.  
- Kick again on beat 3, snare on 4.  
- The energy is low, but electric. A waiting room. A breath held.

**Bar 2: Diane (Piano) — Comp on 2 and 4**  
- Dm7 (D F A C) on beat 2, with a chromatic approach from E♭ to D.  
- A7#9 on beat 4, with a quick F# in the left hand.  
- She plays sparse, but with tension — like she’s holding back something huge.

---

**Bar 2: Marcus (Bass) — Walking line, chromatic approaches**  
- Dm7 walking line: D → C → B♭ → B → C → D → E♭ → D  
- Chromatic approach to D on beat 2 (E♭ → D).  
- His line is steady, deliberate, and never repeats a note.

---

**Bar 3: Diane (Piano) — Comp on 2 and 4**  
- Gm7 on beat 2.  
- F7#9 on beat 4.  
- The sound grows, but still controlled. Diane is building something — a storm in a teacup.

**Bar 3: Marcus (Bass) — Walking line, chromatic approaches**  
- Gm7 walking line: G → F → E♭ → E → F → G → A♭ → G  
- Chromatic approach to G on beat 2 (A♭ → G).  
- He’s the anchor, but he’s also the narrator — telling a story in the spaces.

---

**Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) — The motif. The moment.**  
- Phrase:  
  - D (beat 1) — a long, open note, like a question.  
  - F (beat 2) — a slight delay, a hesitation.  
  - A (beat 3) — a resolution, but not complete.  
  - C (beat 4) — back to Dm7, but you end on a B♭, a half-step below, leaving it unresolved.  
- No scales, no runs. Just one phrase: searching, reaching, **waiting**.

---

**Bar 4: Little Ray (Drums) — Fill the bar with energy**  
- Hi-hat on every eighth.  
- Kick on 1 and 3.  
- Snare on 2 and 4.  
- A final push — the sound fills the room, but the saxophone lingers on that B♭, open and raw.
