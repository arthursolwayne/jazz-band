**Title: "Whispers Beneath the Concrete"**  
**Key: Fm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick on 1 and 3**  
**Snare on 2 and 4**  
**Hi-hat on every eighth note**  
**Fill:** A sharp, concise ride cymbal hit on beat 3.  
**Feeling:** Suspense. The room holds its breath. The air is thick with anticipation.

---

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano) – Comping**  
**Chords:**  
- **&1:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)  
- **&2:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
- **&3:** Eb7 (Eb, G, Bb, Db)  
- **&4:** Am7b5 (A, C, Eb, G)  

**Style:** Diane plays the chords on the 2nd and 4th beats of the bar, with a slightly delayed attack — like she’s remembering something just before it happens. The chords are sharp, angular, and full of tension.

---

### **Bar 2: Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- **B1:** F (root)  
- **&1:** Ab (chromatic approach)  
- **&2:** Bb (tension)  
- **&3:** A (chromatic resolve)  
- **&4:** G (leading tone to C)  
**Feeling:** Anchor, but with a subtle push forward. It’s not just rhythm — it’s a narrative.

---

### **Bar 2: Little Ray (Drums)**  
Same rhythm as Bar 1, but with a slightly more aggressive hihat and a small snare roll on the & of 3.

---

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax) – Start of Motif**  
**Phrase:**  
- **B1:** F (low F, sustained, breathy)  
- **&1:** Ab (sharp, short, staccato)  
- **&2:** Bb (smooth, legato, like a memory)  
- **&3:** A (half-step resolution, held just a beat too long)  
**Feeling:** Whispering, deliberate. The saxophone is not playing notes — it’s revealing them. Something is being said, but it’s not yet fully formed.

---

### **Bar 4: Full Quartet**  
**Diane:**  
- **&1:** Fm7  
- **&2:** Bb7  
- **&3:** Eb7  
- **&4:** Am7b5  

**Marcus:**  
- **B1:** F  
- **&1:** Ab  
- **&2:** Bb  
- **&3:** A  
- **&4:** G (resolving to C in the next bar)  

**Little Ray:**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hihat on every eighth  
- Ride cymbal on beat 4, leading into the next section  

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **B1:** F (same as before, but now with a slight crescendo)  
- **&1:** Ab (same as before, now with a bit more intensity)  
- **&2:** Bb (same as before, now with a subtle vibrato)  
- **&3:** A (same as before, now with a full, sustained release)  
- **&4:** C (held just a split second longer, as if the note is still hanging in the air)

### **Final Note (End of Bar 4):**  
The last note — a soft, sustained **C** — lingers in the room. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The air in The Cellar is different now. Something has begun.

**That’s your intro.**  
It’s not about showing off. It’s about saying something.  
And in this room, for this moment, it’s enough.
