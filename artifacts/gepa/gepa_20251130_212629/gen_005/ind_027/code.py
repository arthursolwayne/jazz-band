### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums) – Setup the tension**  
**Kick:** On beat 1 only (no 3), creates a sense of uncertainty.  
**Snare:** On beat 2, sharp and dry.  
**Hi-hat:** On all eighths, but with a slight *pull* on beat 4 — like a breath held.  
**Space:** No cymbals, no fills. The room holds still — like a door opening.

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble – Diane (Piano) enters with a 7th chord**  
**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Beat 1:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb) — open and cool.  
- **Beat 2:** Gb7 (Gb, Bb, Db, F) — a chromatic shift, dissonant, mysterious.  
- **Beat 3:** Fm7 again, but with a left-hand chromatic approach from E to F.  
- **Beat 4:** Rest. Silence. Let the air hang.  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line: F, Gb, Ab, A.  
- Chromatic approach on beat 3: A to Ab to Gb.  
- Ends on an open F, lingering beneath the silence.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hihat on all eighths, but with a *swell* on beat 4 — like the room exhales.

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax) – Melody begins**  
**Motif:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (sustained, open, like a memory).  
- **Beat 2:** Ab (a twist, a question).  
- **Beat 3:** Rest. Silence again.  
- **Beat 4:** C (returns, resolved, but not fully — it's a whisper of resolution).  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- F, Gb, Ab, A — same line, but now with a *lighter* touch, like he’s smiling.  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on 2 and 4: Gb7 on beat 2, Fm7 on beat 4.  
- No notes on 1 and 3 — let the sax tell the story.  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same pattern as before, but with a subtle *push* on beat 3 — like he’s leaning in.

### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) – Return to the motif, complete**  
**Motif (continued from Bar 3):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (again, but this time it’s a little more *alive*).  
- **Beat 2:** Ab (same twist, but now it feels intentional).  
- **Beat 3:** Eb (chromatic lead into the final note — a memory made whole).  
- **Beat 4:** F (closed, but not closed — a question without an answer).  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- F, Gb, Ab, Bb — ends on Bb, a half-step above F, like the door is still slightly ajar.  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Fm7 on beat 1, Gb7 on beat 2, Fm7 on beat 3, and a final Ab7 on beat 4 — a chromatic descent, like a sigh.  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1, snare on 2, hihat on every eighth.  
- No fill — just a clean, confident strike on beat 4. The moment is complete.

**Final Effect:**  
The room is still. The weight of the silence is felt. Wayne Shorter leans forward, eyes narrowed, listening. This isn’t just a melody — it’s a question, a memory, a breath held before the storm.  

It’s enough.
