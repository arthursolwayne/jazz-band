### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Pattern:**  
- Kick on **1** and **3**  
- Snare on **2** and **4**  
- Hi-hats: **[x x _ x] x x _ x** (staggered, with a slight backbeat emphasis)  
- Subtle roll on the 2nd beat, adding tension before the band enters  
- Dynamics: soft, with a faint cymbal wash behind the snare

### **Bar 2: Full Band Enters**  
#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
- **F2** (root)  
- **G#2** (chromatic approach to A)  
- **A2** (fifth of F)  
- **G2** (chromatic back to F)  
- **Pattern:** F - G# - A - G - F (repeat with subtle rhythmic variation, walking quarter notes)

#### **Diane (Piano)**  
- **Bar 2:** Rootless voicing on **Fmaj7** → **G7** (chromatic tension)

  - Right hand: **G - B - D - F#** (G7 with a #11)  
- **Bar 3:** Resolves to **Amaj7** (chromatic movement)  
  - Chord: **A - C# - E - G#**  
  - Right hand: **B - D - F# - A**  
- **Bar 4:** Tension again, **B7sus4**

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax)**  
- **Motif:** Simple, haunting, three-note phrase  
  - **F - Bb - D** (over Fmaj7)  
  - Play **F** on beat 1, **Bb** on beat 2 (off the beat slightly), **D** on beat 3, **rest** on beat 4  
- **Rhythm:**  
  - **Bar 3:**  
    - **1:** F (quarter note)  
    - **2:** Bb (eighth note, syncopated)  
    - **3:** D (quarter note)  
    - **4:** rest  
- **Phrasing:** Smooth, legato, with a slight vibrato that builds on the **D**  
- **Dynamics:** Start soft, build to a whisper on the **D**, then leave it hanging

---

### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) – Variation**  
- Repeat the same motif, but **shift** the **Bb** to **beat 3**, and the **D** to **beat 4**, ending on **D** with a slight fade  
- **Rhythm:**  
  - **1:** F (quarter)  
  - **2:** rest  
  - **3:** Bb (eighth)  
  - **4:** D (quarter)  
- **Phrasing:** This time, let the **D** linger — a question mark, not a resolution  
- **Dynamics:** Light, with a breathy edge as if the note is escaping

---

### **Final Moments (Bar 4)**  
- **Little Ray:** Rolls out on the **4th beat**, a soft snare roll  
- **Marcus:** Ends on **F2**, holding it just a moment longer than the rest  
- **Diane:** A final **C** in the right hand, resolving the last chord with a soft, emotional note  
- **You:** Silence. A breath. The room holds it. Wayne Shorter leans slightly forward.

---

**Result:** A four-bar intro that opens a door — not with a statement, but with a question.  
**F - Bb - D** — simple, but it *means* something.  
And maybe, just maybe, it means something to him.
