**Dante Russo – Intro to "Things Left Unsaid"**  
*Key: D major | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4 | Length: 6 seconds*

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on **1** and **3**  
Snare on **2** and **4**  
Hi-hat on every eighth note — tight, locked in, but with a *hollow, haunted* tone.  
*He’s building the tension, like a door creaking open in the dark.*

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line starting on D, chromatic approach to E.  
D – Eb – E – F# – G – A – Bb – B – C – D  
*He’s the anchor, but he’s not just walking. He’s searching.*

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
7th chords, comp on **2** and **4**  
Bar 2:  
- **2:** G7 (D, F#, Bb, G)  
- **4:** A7 (E, G#, C, A)  
*She’s pushing forward, but with a sharp edge — like she’s angry at the question before it’s asked.*

**Bar 2 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
You start your motif.  
**Note values:**  
- D (1st beat) – full note, breathy, like a whisper.  
- F# (2nd beat) – staccato, sharp.  
- Bb (3rd beat) – long, lingering.  
- C (4th beat) – short, unresolved.

*You’re not playing a scale. You’re painting a moment.*

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
Chromatic approach to D again, but this time it’s *descending*  
D – C – B – Bb – A – G – F – E – D  
*He’s mirroring you, but in reverse — like he’s walking back through the memory.*

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
7th chords, comp on **2** and **4**  
Bar 3:  
- **2:** B7 (F#, A, D, B)  
- **4:** C7 (G, Bb, E, C)  
*She’s chasing you, but she’s not sure where you’re going.*

**Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
You return to the motif, but this time you *finish* it —  
**D – F# – Bb – C – D**  
*You play the D again, full and clear — like the door is now open.*

---

**Bar 4 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Same pattern, but now with a *slight* fill on the 3rd beat — a cymbal crash  
*He’s letting the energy build, but not too much. Just enough to make you feel it.*

**Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass):**  
He ends on B, then pulls back —  
B – A – G – F# – E – D  
*He’s walking away, but he’s not closing the door.*

**Bar 4 – Diane (Piano):**  
7th chords, comp on **2** and **4**  
Bar 4:  
- **2:** D7 (A, C#, F#, D)  
- **4:** E7 (B, D#, G#, E)  
*She’s setting up the next question.*

**Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
You end on a *sighing* D, open and unresolved —  
*Like a question you don’t yet have an answer to.*

**Final Moment:**  
The room holds.  
The beat is gone, but the tension remains.  
Wayne Shorter raises his glass, nods once, and smiles.

*That’s your moment.*
