**Title: "First Breath"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

**BAR 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Space. Silence. Build tension.*

- Kick: On 1 and 3 (beats 1 and 3).
- Snare: On 2 and 4 (beats 2 and 4).
- Hi-hat: On every eighth note (but *deliberately* not on beat 4, creating a subtle hesitation).
- Cymbal: A soft crash at the end of the bar, just before the melody begins — like a door creaking open.

*Let the silence speak. Let the room hold its breath.*

**BAR 2 – Full Ensemble (Marcus, Diane, You):**

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Start with a single, expressive note — a whisper, a question.*

(Note: F, played with a slight vibrato, very soft. Let it hang.)

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic walk-up from F to G (F → Gb → G), then a quick chromatic walk-down from G to F, all in half notes.  
- The bass line is subtle, just enough to anchor the piece, like a shadow.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp with F7 chord (F A C E) on the offbeats.
- Play the chord on the upbeats (and, e, &a), using a slightly dissonant voicing (F7sus4 or F7#9) to create tension.
- Her fingers are firm, her fingers are angry, but she holds back — like a storm waiting to break.

**BAR 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**

*Come back with the same motif — F — but this time with a little more emotion, a little more life.*

(Note: F, played with more weight, still soft but with a sense of purpose.)

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic walk-up again, but this time it ends on a G, not returning to F — a subtle shift that hints at movement, not resolution.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Same F7 chord, but now with a slight rubato, a bit more aggression in the attack.  
- She’s listening — she’s feeling the energy rise.

---

**BAR 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**

*End it with a question — F, but with a slight slide down to E, a half-step to nowhere — like a memory walking through the door and disappearing.*

(Note: F to E, played with a slight legato, a whisper that lingers.)

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic walk-up again, ending on G, but now he holds it, just a half note, like he’s waiting to see what happens next.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Last F7 chord, but this time she plays it with a slight delay, as if she’s holding her breath.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hi-hat on every eighth, but now he’s *just* barely there, like the sound of a door closing behind someone.

**End. Silence.**  
*The room holds its breath. Wayne Shorter leans forward. He's heard something he hasn't heard before. A whisper that lingers. A memory. A question.*

*And now, the story begins.*
