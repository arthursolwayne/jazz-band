### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Sound:** A single, low tom hit on beat 1.  
**Feel:** Like the first breath before a scream.  
**Details:**  
- **Beat 1:** Low tom, slightly muted, placed in the center of the room.  
- **Rest of bar:** Absolute silence. No hihat, no snare. Just the weight of that one sound lingering, like a heartbeat in the dark.  
- **Dynamic:** Very soft (pp), but precise. No reverb, no bounce — just the sound of the drum skin itself.

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano) – Comp on 2 and 4**  
**Structure:**  
- **Beat 2:** Dm7 (D F A C)  
- **Beat 4:** Gm7 (G Bb D F)  
**Details:**  
- **Chords:** Both are 7th chords, but Diane plays them with **left-hand rootless voicings**, avoiding cliché.  
- **Beat 2:** F in the left hand, C in the right, with a Bb in the upper register.  
- **Beat 4:** Bb in the left hand, F in the right, with a D in the upper register.  
- **Dynamics:** Soft, but with **a subtle swell** on beat 4 — like something is about to happen.  
- **Space:** No other notes. Just the two chords, with **a long, open space** between them.

### **Bar 3: Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line**  
**Line:**  
- **Beat 1:** D (root)  
- **Beat 2:** F (3rd)  
- **Beat 3:** G (5th)  
- **Beat 4:** C (7th)  
**Details:**  
- The line is **chromatic** on the way up from G to C: G → Ab → A → Bb → C.  
- **Dynamic:** Starts very quiet, but **builds slightly** as the line progresses.  
- **Feel:** Like a man walking through the dark, feeling his way forward, not sure where the light is.  
- **Tone:** Warm, round, with a **slight bow pressure** on the final note (C), giving it a **slightly tense edge**.

### **Bar 4: Dante (Tenor Sax) – Melody**  
**Motif:**  
- **Beat 1:** G (sustained, slightly behind the beat)  
- **Beat 2:** F (short, staccato)  
- **Beat 3:** E (tremolo, very quiet, almost a whisper)  
- **Beat 4:** Rest — **no note, just silence**  
**Details:**  
- The G on beat 1 is **breathy**, almost like a sigh.  
- The F is **sharp, clean, precise**, like a question.  
- The E is **tremolando**, like a whisper of something unresolved.  
- The silence on beat 4 is **intentional**, and **loud** in its absence.  
- **Dynamics:** Starts **ppp**, builds to **mp** on the F, then **pp** on the E, then **nothing**.  
- **Phrasing:** The note G is held just a **hair before** the beat, making it feel like it’s **waiting for something**.  
- **Tone:** Warm, but with **a little growl** in the lower register — like a voice that’s tired but still singing.

---

### **Final Moment: Silence**  
- After the last note (or lack thereof), **no sound for 0.5 seconds**.  
- Then, a **subtle cymbal swish** from Little Ray — just the faintest hint of motion — as if the music is about to begin.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- You feel it in your ribs.  
- The door is open.

**That’s the intro.**  
It’s not a melody yet, but it **is a question** — and the audience is waiting to answer.
