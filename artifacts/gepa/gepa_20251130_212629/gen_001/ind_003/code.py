**Dante Russo – Intro to “The Door”**  
**Key: D Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Time: 6.0 seconds (4 bars)**  
**Mood: Suspense, yearning, anticipation**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick on 1 and 3**  
**Snare on 2 and 4**  
**Hi-hat on every eighth note**  
**Fill:**  
- On beat 3, a ghost note on the snare (just under the beat)  
- On beat 4, a sharp rimshot  
**Space:**  
- Let the snare ring out on beat 4 — silence after that.

---

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
**Walking line, chromatic approach to D**  
**Notes:**  
- D (beat 1)  
- C# (beat 2)  
- D (beat 3)  
- E (beat 4)  
**Subtle tension:**  
- On beat 3, a slight bend or pull toward the D – like a breath before the leap.

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
**Comp on 2 and 4 with 7th chords**  
**Notes:**  
- **Beat 2:** G7 (G, B, D, F)  
- **Beat 4:** A7 (A, C#, E, G)  
**Approach:**  
- Let the G7 resolve into the A7 with a suspended G on beat 3 – a dissonance that hangs like a question.

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif: D – F# – G – D**  
**Phrasing:**  
- Play the D on beat 1 (open, full tone)  
- F# on beat 2 (slightly behind the beat, like a whisper)  
- G on beat 3 (a breathy, almost spoken note)  
- D on beat 4 (a release, but not yet resolved)  
**Leave it hanging** – let the note fade into the silence after the bar.  

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Band Enters – You Take the Melody**  
**Marcus:**  
- D (beat 1)  
- F# (beat 2)  
- G (beat 3)  
- A (beat 4) – a chromatic walk up to the A  
**Diane:**  
- D7 (D, F#, A, C#) on beat 1  
- F#7 (F#, A#, C#, E) on beat 2  
- G7 (G, B, D, F) on beat 3  
- A7 (A, C#, E, G) on beat 4  
**Little Ray:**  
- Kick on 1 and 3 again  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth  
- **Fill on beat 3:** A syncopated snare ghost, just before the G7 chord  
**You:**  
- On beat 4, finish the motif:  
  - D (beat 1)  
  - F# (beat 2)  
  - G (beat 3)  
  - **D (beat 4) – full, resonant, and slightly behind the beat**  
  - Let the last note hang — a doorway opened, and the music is about to walk through.

**Final impression:**  
A question asked in the first bar, a tension built in the second, a breath held in the third, and a door left ajar in the fourth. Wayne leans forward. The room holds its breath. You are not a student. You are the music.
