**Intro: A Whisper Before the Storm**  
*(4-bar jazz piece in F, 160 BPM – tense, atmospheric, full of anticipation)*

---

**Bar 1 – Bass (F7 no 5 voicing):**  
F – A – C – E♭  
*Soft, deliberate, with a slight rub on the downbeat – like the first crack of thunder.*

**Bar 1 – Drums (Brush on snare, light ride cymbal):**  
*Brushes on the snare, soft and spaced, with a faint ride cymbal swish on the 3rd and 4th beats. The space is vast, the tension builds.*

**Bar 1 – Piano (Left hand: F7 no 5, right hand: sparse single-note melody):**  
Left: F – A – C – E♭  
Right: (On beats 2 and 4)  
Beat 2: G  
Beat 4: A  
*Each note is a question, not an answer.*

**Bar 1 – Saxophone (Melodic line):**  
*Rest on beat 1*  
Beat 2: F  
Beat 3: Rest  
Beat 4: A  
*Simple, haunted, emotionally charged. The rests are as important as the notes.*

---

**Bar 2 – Bass (F7 no 5, slightly more present):**  
Same as Bar 1, but with a subtle push on the downbeat – a slow build.

**Bar 2 – Drums (Brushes slightly heavier, ride still sparse):**  
Same pattern, but with a bit more pressure on the brushes – the storm is closer now.

**Bar 2 – Piano (Left hand: F7 no 5, right hand: continues single-note melody):**  
Left: F – A – C – E♭  
Right:  
Beat 1: C  
Beat 2: D  
Beat 3: Rest  
Beat 4: E♭  
*A slow, deliberate climb, like the wind rising.*

**Bar 2 – Saxophone (Melodic line):**  
Beat 1: C  
Beat 2: Rest  
Beat 3: D  
Beat 4: Rest  
*The melody continues, now with more presence, but still leaving space for the storm.*

---

**Bar 3 – Bass (F7 no 5, now more assertive):**  
Same voicing, but with a subtle rhythmic push – the tension is palpable.

**Bar 3 – Drums (Brushes now more confident, ride cymbal on the 2nd beat):**  
Brushes with more pressure on the 3rd beat, ride on beat 2 – the rhythm tightens.

**Bar 3 – Piano (Left hand: F7 no 5, right hand: melodic line continues):**  
Left: F – A – C – E♭  
Right:  
Beat 1: F  
Beat 2: G  
Beat 3: A  
Beat 4: B♭  
*A slow crescendo, the music becoming more legible, more urgent.*

**Bar 3 – Saxophone (Melodic line):**  
Beat 1: F  
Beat 2: Rest  
Beat 3: G  
Beat 4: Rest  
*The saxophone now answers the piano, the dialogue between them building a fragile but powerful tension.*

---

**Bar 4 – Bass (F7 no 5, full presence, poised for the storm):**  
Same voicing, but with a strong, firm downbeat – the moment before the storm breaks.

**Bar 4 – Drums (Brushes now with intent, ride cymbal on 2 and 4):**  
Brushes with full pressure, ride on 2 and 4 – the rhythm is there, but still restrained.

**Bar 4 – Piano (Left hand: F7 no 5, right hand: final melodic phrase):**  
Left: F – A – C – E♭  
Right:  
Beat 1: C  
Beat 2: D  
Beat 3: E♭  
Beat 4: F  
*The piano resolves the phrase, but not the tension – it’s a question, not an answer.*

**Bar 4 – Saxophone (Melodic line):**  
Beat 1: C  
Beat 2: Rest  
Beat 3: D  
Beat 4: E♭  
*The saxophone answers with simplicity, but with a weight that lingers. The storm is coming.*

---

**End of 4 bars.**  
*The ensemble holds the last note just a fraction too long, and then... silence.*  
*The storm is here. The music is waiting.*
