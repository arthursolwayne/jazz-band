**Dante Russo — 4-Bar Intro in Dm, 160 BPM**  
*For Wayne Shorter, at The Cellar, 2:00 AM*

---

**Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s):**  
**Drums (Little Ray):**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Hi-hat on every eighth, but *softly*, like a whisper.  
- 1: Kick, hi-hat  
- 2: Snare, hi-hat  
- 3: Kick, hi-hat  
- 4: Snare, hi-hat  
*Let the silence speak. The energy is there, but it’s waiting. The room breathes.*

---

**Bar 2 (1.5 - 3.0s):**  
**Bass (Marcus):**  
Roots and fifths in Dm, with a chromatic approach on the 3rd.  
- Dm7: D – A – C – F  
- Chromatic approach on the 3rd (F): E♭ – F  
- Root on 1, fifth on 2, chromatic on 3, root on 4.  
*Marcus walks with the gravity of a man who’s seen too many nights like this.*

---

**Bar 3 (3.0 - 4.5s):**  
**Piano (Diane):**  
Open voicings, one chord per bar.  
- Bar 2: Dm7 (D – F – A – C)  
- Bar 3: B♭m7♭5 (B♭ – D♭ – F – A♭)  
*She’s angry, but she’s precise. The chords don’t just support — they challenge.*

---

**Bar 4 (4.5 - 6.0s):**  
**Tenor Sax (Dante):**  
You enter with a short, singing motif — not a scale, not a run. Just a question.

**Motif:**  
- D (1)  
- F (2)  
- C (3)  
- D (4)  
*You play it on the first four notes of the bar — start it, leave it hanging. Then…*  
- Silence on the 5th and 6th beats.  
- On the 7th, you come back with a half-step lower: C (7)  
- End on D (8) — a question, unresolved.  
*You don’t need to answer. You just need to make him lean forward.*

**End of 4 Bars.**  
The room holds its breath.  
Wayne Shorter nods.  
He’s listening.
