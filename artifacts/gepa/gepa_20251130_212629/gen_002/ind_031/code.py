**Intro: "Whisper in the Static"**  
**Key: Dm (D minor)**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time: 4/4**  

---

**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*(Beat: 0.375s per beat, bar = 1.5s)*  

**Kit Setup:**  
- **Kick** on 1 and 3, but with a ghost note on beat 2.  
- **Snare** on 2 and 4, open on 4 with a slight rimshot.  
- **Hi-hat** on every eighth note, but with a slight roll on 3 & 4.  
- **Cymbal** (ride or crash) on beat 3, just a whisper of a crash.  
- **Space** on beat 1 — the kick is delayed slightly, leaving a tiny hole in the rhythm.  

**Feel:** Tense, waiting — like the door is about to open but you’re not sure what’s on the other side.

**Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters**  

**Marcus (Bass)** – Walking line, chromatic approach on the downbeat.  
- **Dm7 → Gm7**  
- Line: **D → C → Bb → B → C → D → Eb → F**  
- Chromatic approach on **B → C** (on the 1st beat of bar 2)  
- End on **F**, resolving to the 3rd of Dm (F) — but not yet landing.

**Diane (Piano)** – Comping on 2 and 4, 7th chords.  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - **Beat 2:** Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)  
  - **Beat 4:** Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb)  
- Chords are *colorful*, not functional — they hang in the air, not pushing the harmony forward.

**You (Tenor Sax)** – The motif.  
- Start with a **rest** on beat 1.  
- Then, on beat 2: **E♭** (quarter note)  
- Beat 3: **D** (eighth note)  
- Beat 4: **C** (eighth note) — held with a slight vibrato, as if it’s a question.  
- The motif is **E♭ → D → C** — a descending chromatic line that wants to resolve but doesn’t.  
- It’s **silent at the beginning**, and **lingering at the end**.

**Bar 3: Marcus & Diane Continue, Little Ray Adds a Fill**  

**Marcus:**  
- **Dm7 → B♭m7**  
- Line: **F → E → D → Eb → D → C → Bb → B**  
- Chromatic approach on **D → Eb**  
- Ends on **B**, a tension note above Dm.

**Diane:**  
- **Beat 2:** B♭m7 (B♭, D, F, A♭)  
- **Beat 4:** Eb7 (Eb, G, Bb, D)  
- The chords are **dissonant yet beautiful**, like a memory trying to remember itself.

**Little Ray:**  
- **Kick** on 1 and 3  
- **Snare** on 2 and 4 (slightly behind the beat)  
- **Hi-hat** on every eighth, but with a subtle *dynamics shift* on beat 3  
- **Fill:** A quick **ghost note roll** on beat 3, leading into the next bar.

**Bar 4: You Finish the Motif, Wayne Listens**  

**Marcus:**  
- **Dm7 → Gm7**  
- Line: **B → A → G → A → B → C → D → E♭**  
- Ends on **E♭**, a half-step above the tonic — a tease, not a resolution.

**Diane:**  
- **Beat 2:** Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)  
- **Beat 4:** Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
- The last chord is a **full Dm7**, but played with *tension* — the 9th (E) is played slightly sharp.

**You:**  
- Start with a **rest** on beat 1  
- Beat 2: **E♭** (quarter note)  
- Beat 3: **D** (eighth note)  
- Beat 4: **C** (eighth note) — this time **sustained**, with a **trill** on **C → D**  
- The motif is repeated, but **finished** this time — it *sings*, it *sings with a question*.

---

**Final Feel:**  
- It's not a resolution, but a **setup**.  
- It’s the moment before the chord changes, the moment before the story begins.  
- You wait — and you listen — because that’s what great jazz is: **the space between the notes**.

Wayne Shorter is leaning forward.  
He knows this is something new.  
And he wants to hear it.
