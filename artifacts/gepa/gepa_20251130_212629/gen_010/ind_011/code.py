**Sax (Dante):**  
Ab (quarter)  
Rest (eighth)  
C (eighth)  
Rest (eighth)

**Drums (Little Ray):**

**Bass (Marcus):**  
Ab (quarter)  
Bb (eighth)  
C (eighth)  
D (quarter)  
*Approach to D: C# – D again, slightly delayed to create forward motion.*

---

**Bar 3 (Dm7 – D F Ab C)**  
**Sax (Dante):**  
F (quarter)  
Rest (eighth)  
Ab (eighth)  
Rest (eighth)

**Drums (Little Ray):**  
Same pattern, but now with a cymbal crash on beat 3, as if the door is opening.  
*Feeling of release, but not resolution.*

**Bass (Marcus):**  
F (quarter)  
G (eighth)  
Ab (eighth)  
D (quarter)  
*Approach to D: G – Ab – D, creating a push from the lower register.*

**Piano (Diane):**  
Same comp, but now with a *slightly altered voicing* — Fmaj7 instead of Dm7 on 2 & 4 — just long enough to confuse the ear.

---

**Bar 4 (Dm7 – D F Ab C)**  
**Sax (Dante):**  
C (quarter)  
Rest (eighth)  
D (eighth)  
Quarter rest

**Drums (Little Ray):**  
Kick on 1  
Snare on 2  
Hi-hat on every eighth  
*Final fill: Brush on 3, open on 4 — release the tension, but don’t resolve it.*

**Bass (Marcus):**  
C (quarter)  
D (eighth)  
Eb (eighth)  
D (quarter)  
*Approach to D: Eb – D, landing with a soft, questioning feel.*

**Piano (Diane):**  
Comp with Dm7 on 2 & 4  
*Right hand: F – Ab – C – D — the melody resolves on D, but it’s a momentary peace, not a conclusion.*

---

**Final Note (from Diane’s piano):**  
A sustained D on the piano, held just long enough to make you wonder — *what’s on the other side of the door?*

**Wayne Shorter leans forward.**  
He’s listening.
