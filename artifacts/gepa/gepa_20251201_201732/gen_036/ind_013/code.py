**Key:** Fm (F minor)  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM (4/4 time)  
**Duration:** 6 seconds total (1.5 seconds per bar)  
**Mood:** Question, yearning, unresolved — like a door that’s just opened, but you don’t know what’s on the other side.

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On beats 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Feel:** Tight, precise, with a slight *push* behind the beat — like a heartbeat that’s just a little too eager.

> *No melody, no harmony — just rhythm. The audience leans in. The silence is broken.*

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**  
**Chord:** B♭7 (Fm ii-V)  
**Voicing:** Open, spaced out — B♭ in the right hand, F in the left.  
**Comping:** On beats 2 and 4  
**Phrase:** A single B♭ sustained for the first half of the bar, then released on beat 2.  
> *The first note of the story. A whisper of the key, a hint of tension.*

### **Bar 3: Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- Beat 1: D2 (Fm root)  
- Beat 2: C2 (chromatic approach to B♭)  
- Beat 3: B♭2 (Fm ii)  
- Beat 4: A♭2 (chromatic approach to G)  
> *The anchor, the foundation. It’s not about the notes — it's about the space between them.*

---

### **Bar 4: Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif:**  
- Beat 1: F (Fm root) — a long, drawn-out note.  
- Beat 2: Rest.  
- Beat 3: G (chromatic above F) — a half note, floating.  
- Beat 4: F — return to the root, but not quite resolved.  
> *The question. The moment. The thing that makes Wayne Shorter lean forward.*

**Final Note (Bar 4, Beat 4):**  
A long F on the tenor, held just past the beat. It lingers in the air, unanswered. No resolution, no closure. Just a beginning.

> *The room holds its breath. The story hasn’t started yet — but it’s already real.*
