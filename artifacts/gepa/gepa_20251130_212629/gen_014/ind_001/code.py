- *Kick on 1 and 3*  
- *Snare on 2 and 4*  
- *Hi-hat on every eighth note*  
- *Space on the "and" of 4 — a rest, a breath, a pause before the storm*

- *Dm7 with a #11 (D F A C E)* on beat 2  
- *Fm7 (F A C E)* on beat 4  
- *Sparse, angular, with a touch of tension — she’s not chasing you, she’s watching*

**Bar 2 (1.5s - 3.0s): Marcus on Bass — walking line, chromatic approach to D**  
- *D → C → B → A → G → F# → E → D*  
- *Root on beat 1 (D), chromatic descent, ends on D again*  
- *Fingered with the weight of decades — no vibrato, just tone*

- *D (tenor sax, low register, breathy, almost whispered)*

- *G → F# → F → E → D → C# → C → G*  
- *Root on beat 1 (G), chromatic descent, ends on G again*  
- *Same tone, same patience — he’s been there before*

**Bar 3 (3.0s - 4.5s): You (Dante) on Tenor — the answer**

- *A → G# → G → F# → F → E → D# → A*  
- *Root on beat 1 (A), chromatic descent, ends on A again*  
- *Same rhythm, same purpose — he’s been waiting for this moment*

**Bar 4 (4.5s - 6.0s): You (Dante) on Tenor — the motif, the moment**  
- *Play the two-note motif again: D → F#*  
- *This time, with a little more air, a little more muscle*  
- *Rest on beat 2*  
- *Rest on beat 3*  
- *Rest on beat 4*  
- *The melody is not finished — it’s just begun*

*The room holds its breath. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The next song begins.*

*You wait for him to decide if it's worth listening to.*
