---

**BAR 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth  
- *But leave the last eighth of bar 1 empty — a breath before the storm.*

---

**BAR 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
- **F2 (MIDI 53)** – root  
- **A2 (MIDI 57)** – fifth  
- **G2 (MIDI 58)** – chromatic approach up  
- **F2 (MIDI 53)** – back to root  
- *Walking line: F – G – A – F*  
- *F2 (MIDI 53) to C2 (MIDI 48) on the “and” of 2 (chromatic descent), then back to F2 on beat 3.*

**BAR 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chord: Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb)**  
- Open voicing:  
  - **Right hand:** Eb (MIDI 59) – C (MIDI 48) – Ab (MIDI 60) – F (MIDI 53)  
  - **Left hand:** C (MIDI 48) – F (MIDI 53)  
- Comp on beat 2 only:  
  - Strum the chord with a slight rubato, letting the Ab ring out as a dissonant question.

---

**BAR 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Bb2 (MIDI 51)** – chromatic descent  
- **A2 (MIDI 57)** – fifth again  
- **G2 (MIDI 58)** – chromatic approach up  
- **F2 (MIDI 53)** – back to root  
- *Walking line: Bb – A – G – F*  
- *Same chromatic motion, but now resolving down — a subtle pull toward the home key.*

---

**BAR 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chord: G7 (G, B, D, F)**  
- Open voicing:  
  - **Right hand:** F (MIDI 53) – D (MIDI 45) – B (MIDI 50) – G (MIDI 47)  
  - **Left hand:** D (MIDI 45) – G (MIDI 47)  
- Comp on beat 4 only:  
  - Again, a slow release, letting the F ring out — a blue note that lingers, unresolved.

---

**BAR 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:**  
  - **F (MIDI 64)** – short, punchy  
  - **Ab (MIDI 66)** – next note, a half-step above  
  - **G (MIDI 65)** – back down, a chromatic grace  
  - **F (MIDI 64)** – the same note, but now with a little more weight  
- *Let the F hang — no resolution, just a breath before the storm.*

---

**BAR 4 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth  
- *Fill the bar — this time, no empty space.*

**Final Effect:**  
This intro is a quiet scream — a saxophone whisper that lingers like a memory. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The room holds its breath. The storm is coming.
