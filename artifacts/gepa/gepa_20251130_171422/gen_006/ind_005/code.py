**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
A single, open hi-hat on the “&” of 1, followed by a soft, half-muted snare on beat 2. The kick hits on beat 3, and a light brush stroke on the “&” of 4. The bar is breathless — a pause before the storm. The rhythm is sparse, but the tension is high. Every beat feels like it’s waiting for something to happen.

**Bar 2 – Full Ensemble (Marcus, Diane, Little Ray):**  
- **Marcus (Bass):** Starts with a chromatic walk down from Fm7 (F, Eb, D, C). He plays the line:  
  **F – Eb – D – C** (half notes), each note slightly behind the beat, like he’s carrying the weight of the room.  
- **Diane (Piano):** Comping with Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb) on beat 2 and 4. She plays a subtle descending line over the chords:  
  **Ab – G – F – Eb**, resolving only on the last note.  
- **Little Ray:** Now with a full rhythm. Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4, hihat on every eighth. But he’s playing just slightly behind the beat, giving space for the melody.  
- **You (Tenor Sax):** A single, haunted motif —  
  **F – Eb – D – C**, played with a slow, breathy tone. The first note is held, then the rest are drawn out, like a memory surfacing. You end on a sustain over the C, letting the note hang in the air.

**Bar 3 – Full Ensemble (Marcus, Diane, Little Ray):**  
- **Marcus (Bass):** Chromatic walk up from C to F: **C – Db – D – Eb – F**. Each note is spaced with a half-note value, moving with the tension.  
- **Diane (Piano):** Still comping on 2 and 4. She adds a line over the chords: **C – Bb – Ab – G**, resolving on G, which feels unresolved in Fm.  
- **Little Ray:** Hits the same rhythm, but now with a subtle accent on the “&” of 3, adding a push that feels like a question.  
- **You (Tenor Sax):** Return to the motif, but this time you start it again on the “&” of 1, and then leave it hanging on a rest at beat 2. It’s a different voice — softer, more intimate. You end the bar with a single, long note on D, barely audible.

**Bar 4 – Full Ensemble (Marcus, Diane, Little Ray):**  
- **Marcus (Bass):** Chromatic line again, **F – Eb – D – C**, but this time he plays it with a slight rubato feel, as if he’s remembering something.  
- **Diane (Piano):** Comping with Fm7 on 2 and 4. She plays a single, descending line: **Ab – G – F – Eb**, but ends on F instead of Eb. It’s a half-resolving, a tease.  
- **Little Ray:** Full rhythm again, but now he fills the bar with a subtle cymbal roll at the end, like the moment is stretching, like the silence is holding its breath.  
- **You (Tenor Sax):** The motif returns one last time — **F – Eb – D – C**, but this time you don’t finish it. You end on a rest, leaving the last note of the motif unplayed. The silence is the resolution. It’s not a resolution — it’s an invitation.

**Final Moment:**  
The room is silent for a beat. Wayne Shorter leans forward in his chair, the whiskey half-finished, his eyes locked on the stage.  
You look at Marcus, then Diane, then Ray. You nod.  
The next note is yours.
