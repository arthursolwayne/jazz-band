**Title: "Whispers in the Cellar"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray – Drums**  
**Rhythm:**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note  
- **Subtle fill on the "and" of 2**, just a soft ride cymbal brush  
- **Space on the "and" of 4** – a breath before the storm  

> *The room holds its breath. The bulb flickers. A silence before the sound.*

---

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **F – G♭ – G – A** (walking line, chromatic approach to A)  
- **A – B♭ – B – C** (next measure)  
> *Steady, grounded, never repeating a note.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **F7 (F A C E)** on beat 2  
- **A7 (A C# E G)** on beat 4  
> *Dissonance and resolve — her chords are sharp, but they serve the story.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif (Bar 2):**  
  - **F (beat 1)** – a low, whispering tone  
  - **Rest (beat 2)** – silence is the first note  
  - **G (beat 3)** – a cry, a question  
  - **Rest (beat 4)** – leaving it hanging, unresolved  
> *It’s not a melody yet — it’s a feeling. A memory waiting to be found.*

---

### **Bar 3: Tenor Sax (Continued)**  
- **Motif (Bar 3):**  
  - **A (beat 1)** – a step forward, a step into the unknown  
  - **B♭ (beat 2)** – a whisper of tension  
  - **C (beat 3)** – the first release  
  - **Rest (beat 4)** – still breathing, still waiting  
> *You're not telling the story — you're inviting it in.*

---

### **Bar 4: Tenor Sax (Final)**  
- **Motif (Bar 4):**  
  - **F (beat 1)** – back to the beginning  
  - **G (beat 2)** – the question returns  
  - **A (beat 3)** – the answer is in the air  
  - **F (beat 4)** – resolve, but not final  
> *A cycle. A beginning. A moment that lingers.*

---

### **Final Moment:**
- **Little Ray** lets the last beat fade with a soft cymbal wash.  
- **Marcus** ends with a **C**, holding it just a moment too long.  
- **Diane** leaves a final **F7** chord, hanging in the air.  
- **You** hold your **F** for a second longer, then exhale — the breath of the room.

**Wayne Shorter leaned forward.**  
He’s heard a lot of things, but this — this is something new.  
Something real.  
Something that *wants* to be heard.

Now the music begins.
