  "rationale": "This arrangement lacks essential jazz elements. The piano and bass use basic triads (C, D, G, F) without 7th extensions or functional harmony. The rhythm section has no syncopation - hihat plays straight eighth notes on 1&2&3&4& with no Latin feel. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The trumpet is silent throughout, and there's no call-and-response between instruments. The arrangement sounds more like a music theory exercise than authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) and add extensions (9ths, 13ths)",
    "Add chromatic approach notes and enclosures to saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce syncopated hihat patterns with emphasis on upbeats for Latin jazz groove",
    "Add walking bass lines with root-3rd-5th-7th motion instead of static triads",
    "Include ii-V-I progressions (e.g., Dm7-G7-Cmaj7) for authentic jazz harmony"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns. Specify that trumpet should have melodic content, not just rests."
