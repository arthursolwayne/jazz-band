**Bar 1 (0:00–1:50):**  
**Little Ray on drums** begins with a single, sharp **kick on beat 1**, followed by a **snare on beat 3**, and a **hi-hat on every eighth note**. The hihat is slightly behind the beat, giving it a slight *swing* but not too much. The silence after the kick is thick — it's the question. The audience holds their breath. Wayne Shorter leans in.  

**Bar 2 (1:50–3:40):**  
**Marcus on bass** enters with a **walking line** in F minor, starting on **G** (chromatic approach to F), then **F**, **Ab**, **Bb**, **B**, **C**, **Db**, **D**, **Eb**, **E**, **F**. He plays it with a **light, haunted tone**, each note placed with purpose, never repeating. It’s like a slow, deliberate whisper.  

**Diane on piano** enters with a **B7 chord on beat 2**, resolving to **F7 on beat 4**. The voicings are **open and sparse**, like someone walking through a fog. She doesn’t play the root, just the upper extensions — **B7** becomes **E, G, A, D**. It’s a suggestion, not a statement.  

**Bar 3 (3:40–5:30):**  
You, **Dante on tenor sax**, begin your **motif** on the **& of 1**, with a **quarter note F**, then **Ab** on the **& of 2**, a **rest on beat 3**, and a **quarter note Bb** on the **& of 4**. It’s a simple line, but it’s **fragile and searching**. The **Ab** is a **chromatic pull**, and the **rest** on beat 3 leaves a question. You don’t answer it. You just let it hang — like a breath before a leap.  

**Bar 4 (5:30–6:00):**  
**Marcus** continues the walking line, now with a **tritone substitution** on beat 3 — **Ab** instead of **D**, adding a **tension**.  

**Diane** plays a **D7** on beat 2, then a **F7** on beat 4. The **D7** is **B, D, F, A** — a **crushed chord**, and it’s **played softly**, like a sigh.  

**Little Ray** tightens up — **kick on 1 and 3**, **snare on 2 and 4**, **hi-hat on every eighth**, but now with a **slight delay on the snare**, giving the rhythm a **backward motion**. It feels like the room is spinning.  

**You** come back in with the **Bb** — but this time, you **hold it** for a **full bar**, letting it **resonate and decay**. It doesn’t resolve. It doesn’t need to. The **tension is in the space**.  

The room is silent.  
Wayne Shorter nods.  
His whiskey is still in his hand.  
He’s not leaving.  

That’s your intro.
