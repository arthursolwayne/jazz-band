**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. A tight, driving groove that sets the mood. The room holds its breath. The silence is heavy. The heartbeat of the intro.*

**Bar 2: Marcus (Bass) enters**  
*Walking line in Fm, chromatic approach to the 3rd (E♭), then a chromatic run up to B♭. He plays:  
Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D) → chromatic run: G♭, G, A♭, B♭ → then resolves to a B♭ on beat 2.*  
*His line is a question. A search. He’s not here to answer — he’s here to ask.*

**Bar 3: Diane (Piano) enters**  
*Comping on 2 and 4 with F7 chords (F, A, C, E♭). She plays:  
On beat 2: F7 (F, A, C, E♭)  
On beat 4: F7 with a chromatic passing tone (F, A, C, E♭, D).  
She’s pushing you forward, but with tension. The harmony is daring. It wants more.*

**Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) enter — the moment**  
*You take the melody. One short, clear motif. It’s not a run — it’s a phrase. It has shape, space, and a question in it.*  
**Phrase:**  
- Beat 1: F (sustained, open, with a slight growl in the lower register)  
- Beat 2: G♭ (a half-step up — tension, like a door creaking open)  
- Beat 3: A♭ (a half-step up again — the question becomes a challenge)  
- Beat 4: B♭ (a resolution, but not complete — it lingers, unresolved, like a voice calling your name)  

*You leave it hanging. The room is quiet. Wayne Shorter leans forward. It’s not just a melody — it’s a memory, a thought, a question that lingers in the air.*

**End of Intro.**  
*The room holds its breath. The music is waiting. You’ve made the first move. Now it’s up to the rest of the quartet — and the man in the back with the whiskey.*
