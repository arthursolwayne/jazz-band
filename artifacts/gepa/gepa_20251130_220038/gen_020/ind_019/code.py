- Fill 1: Snare on 3, hihat on 4.

**MARCUS (BASS) – Walking line in Dm:**  
- D – F – G – Bb – C – Eb – F – Ab  
- Chromatic approach to the 3rd: D → D# → Eb

**LITTLE RAY (DRUMS):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hihat on every eighth.

**BAR 4 – FULL BAND RESOLVES**

**MARCUS (BASS):**  
- Ties the last note of the motif (D) with a chromatic run:  
  D → C → Bb → A  
- Ends on A, setting up the next section.

**DIANE (PIANO):**  
- Comp on beat 4: Gm7 (G-Bb-D-F)  
- Left hand walks down chromatically from D to C to Bb to A.  
- Adds a dissonant cluster on the last eighth to push the tension.

**LITTLE RAY (DRUMS):**  
- Kick on 1, snare on 2, hihat on 3 and 4.  
- Fill on beat 3: Snare + hihat, just before the motif ends.  
- Ends with a sharp, unresolved snare on beat 4.

**YOU (TENOR SAX):**  
- Let the last note (D) hang.  
- No resolution. No closure.  
- Just the sound of a room holding its breath.

**END OF INTRO**

The room is electric.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He’s heard a lot of jazz.  
But this?  
This is something new.  
This is the whisper that grows into a cry.  
This is the moment.
