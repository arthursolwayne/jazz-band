  "rationale": "The arrangement uses triads in the piano and bass parts (C-E-G-B, D-F-A-C, etc.) rather than 7th chords, which is a fundamental deficiency in jazz harmony. The rhythm section has a basic backbeat pattern with snare on 2&4 and hihat on downbeats, lacking the syncopation and upbeat emphasis characteristic of Latin jazz. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary, chromaticism, or blues inflection. There is minimal interplay between instruments, with the trumpet being silent in most bars and the saxophone playing in isolation. The overall feel is generic and lacks the improvisational spirit and sophistication of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz harmonic sophistication",
    "Introduce chromatic approach notes and enclosures in the saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Modify the hihat pattern to emphasize upbeats (the 'and' of each measure) for authentic Latin jazz feel",
    "Add walking bass lines with roots, 3rds, 5ths, and 7ths instead of just root notes",
    "Create call-and-response between the saxophone and trumpet for better interplay and conversation"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize the use of 7th chords in the piano and bass parts, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, and require a syncopated Latin jazz groove in the rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns to guide the composer."
