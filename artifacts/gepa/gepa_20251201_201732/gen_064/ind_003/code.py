**Intro: "Whispers in the Cellar"**  
*Key: D Minor | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4 | Length: 6 seconds*

---

**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.*  
- Starts with a slow, deliberate roll on the hihat, building tension.  
- Kick hits on 1 and 3 with a dry, resonant click.  
- Snare on 2 and 4, but soft, like a heartbeat.  
- The bar feels empty, but full of anticipation.

**Bar 2: Marcus (Bass)**  
*Walking line (D2-G2, MIDI 38-43), roots and fifths with chromatic approaches.*  
- D2 (root)  
- F#2 (chromatic approach to G2)  
- G2 (fifth)  
- A2 (chromatic approach to Bb2)  
- Bb2 (flatted ninth, unresolved tension)  
- *Says nothing, but tells the story of a man who’s seen everything.*

**Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**  
*Open voicings, different chord each bar, resolve on the last.*  
- Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
- A7 (A, C#, E, G)  
- Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
- Ends on a Dm7 again.  
- Her fingers are sharp, each chord a question.

**Bar 3: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hihat on every eighth, but now faster, more urgent.  
- A fill on the second half of the bar — a quick triplet on the hihat, resolving into the next bar.

- Dm7  
- Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)

**Bar 4: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hihat on every eighth.  
- A quick ride cymbal on the last eighth of the bar — a flourish, like a breath held.

- D2 (root)  
- F#2 (chromatic)  
- G2 (fifth)  
- A2 (chromatic)

- C7 (C, E, G, Bb)  
- Ends on a Dm7 with a sharp, staccato chord — a question mark.

**Bar 4: Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
- You enter on the last beat of bar 4.  
- A single, slow, long note: **D** (D4, MIDI 62)  
- Played with a breathy, open tone.  
- Let it hang for a beat.  
- Then, on the "and" of 1, a quick, dark note: **F#** (F#4, MIDI 66)  
- That’s it.  
- Let the silence speak.  
- Let Wayne Shorter lean forward.  
- Let the story begin.

**Final Note:**  
You’ve set the stage. The room is quiet. The whiskey in the back is still.  
But you know — this is just the beginning.
