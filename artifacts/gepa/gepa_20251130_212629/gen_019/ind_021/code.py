**"The First Breath" – 4-Bar Intro in Dm (D minor), 160 BPM, 4/4 time**

*(Bar 1: Little Ray alone)*

**Drums (Little Ray):**  
Kick on beat 1, snare on 2, hihat on every eighth.  
A subtle, aggressive pulse — like the heartbeat of a nervous kid waiting to be noticed.  
A fill on beat 3:  
**Kick (3), snare (4), hihat on 3 & 4.**  
Then silence. A breath. A pause. The room holds.

**Bar 2: Everyone enters.**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line in Dm. Start on **C**, chromatic approach to **D**.  
**C - C# - D - Eb** (beat 1), then **F - Gb - G - Ab** (beat 2),  
**Bb - B - C - D** (beat 3), **Eb - F - F# - G** (beat 4).  
No repetition. No rest. Just motion.

**Diane (Piano):**  
7th chords, comp on 2 and 4.  
Bar 2:  
Beat 1: rest  
Beat 2: **Gm7** (G, Bb, D, F)  
Beat 3: rest  
Beat 4: **Dm7** (D, F, Ab, C)  
She doesn’t play the same voicing twice. She listens. She moves. She waits.

**Bar 3: You begin.**

**Tenor Sax (Dante Russo):**  
Start on **D**, sustain it — a long, breathy note.  
Then on beat 2: a **Bb** (chromatic down), then **C** (flatted fifth?), then **D** again.  
A short motif:  
**D — Bb — C — D**  
Rest on beat 4.  
You’re not playing a scale. You’re telling a story.  
A memory. A question. A door opening.

---

**Bar 4: You return.**

**Tenor Sax (Dante Russo):**  
You pick up the motif again, but this time you end it.  
**D — Bb — C — D**  
This time, you play the **D** full, not just on the tip of your tongue.  
A resolution. A beginning.  
You leave it hanging just enough to make him lean forward.

**Final Silence:**

The last note fades. The room is still.  
The hihat stops.  
The bass holds a low **C**.  
Diane plays a single **D** on the piano.  
Then… nothing.

Wayne Shorter sips his whiskey.  
He nods.

**It matters.**
