**Dante Russo — 4-Bar Jazz Intro in D (160 BPM)**

**Key:** D minor  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Style:** Modern jazz, introspective with a pulse of energy

---

**Bar 1 — Little Ray (Drums):**

- **Kick drum:** On beat 1 and 3 — but not evenly. Beat 1 is slightly delayed, like a hesitation. Beat 3 is accented, sharp.
- **Snare drum:** On 2 and 4 — but with a subtle swing. Beat 2 is ghosted, beat 4 is a sharp snap.
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note, but with dynamic variation. The first two eighths are soft, then a strong accent on the third and fourth, creating a tension that builds toward the next bar.
- **Space:** The last eighth of the bar ends with a rest, leaving a moment of silence that feels like a breath before the next chord.

**Bar 2 — Full Quartet (Dante, Diane, Marcus, Ray):**

- **Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
  - Starts with a single note: **D**, held for two eighth notes.  
  - Then a short motif: **F#** (quarter note), **Bb** (eighth), **A** (eighth), **G** (quarter note) — played with a breathy, smoky tone.  
  - Ends on **G**, holding it for a beat, then a rest.

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - Comp with **Dm7** (D, F#, A, C) on beat 2.  
  - Then a **Bb7** (Bb, D, F, Ab) on beat 4, played with a dissonant, angular voicing.  
  - Her left hand walks chromatically: **C → B → A → Bb**.

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - Walking line: **D → C → B → Bb**  
  - Chromatic approach to the **Bb** on beat 4, creating tension.

- **Ray (Drums):**  
  - Kick on 1 and 3 again, but slightly ahead of the beat on beat 3.  
  - Snare on 2 and 4 with a slight delay on 4.  
  - Hi-hat continues, but now with a more aggressive pulse.

**Bar 3 — Full Quartet:**

- **Dante:**  
  - Returns with the **G** from the end of bar 2.  
  - Then a new motif: **A** (quarter), **Bb** (eighth), **C** (eighth), **D** (quarter).  
  - Ends on **D**, unresolved, like a question.

- **Diane:**  
  - Comp with **Dm7** on 2, **G7** (G, B, D, F) on 4.  
  - Left hand walks: **Bb → A → G → F**, creating a descending line.

- **Marcus:**  
  - Chromatic line again: **F → E → D → C**.

- **Ray:**  
  - Same pattern as bar 2, but now with more urgency.  
  - Snare on 4 is a strong, open snap.

**Bar 4 — Full Quartet:**

- **Dante:**  
  - Resolves the **D** with a **Bb** (quarter), then a **C** (eighth), **D** (eighth), **F#** (quarter).  
  - Ends with a long, sustained **D** — a whisper, like a memory.

- **Diane:**  
  - Comp with **Dm7** on 2, **G7** on 4.  
  - Left hand: **C → B → A → G** — a smooth descent.

- **Marcus:**  
  - Chromatic: **D → C → B → A**.

- **Ray:**  
  - Kick on 1 and 3, but now on beat 3 it's held for a full beat.  
  - Snare on 4 is a sharp snap, and the hi-hat fades out.

**Final Moment:**

- Silence for one eighth note after the final note.  
- The room is still.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- You feel it.
