### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Rhythm:**  
- Kick: 1 & 3  
- Snare: 2 & 4  
- Hi-hat: On every eighth  
- Dynamics: Soft, with a subtle crescendo into the second bar  

**Feel:**  
A slow build, like the click of a matchstick in the dark. The groove is tight, but not pushy — it’s waiting, listening, as if the room itself is holding its breath.

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano – Comping)**  
**Chord:**  
- **Bar 2:** Dm7♭5 (D F A♭ C)  
  - Open voicing: Left hand: D (MIDI 62), A♭ (MIDI 67)  
  - Right hand: F (MIDI 65), C (MIDI 60)  
  - Resolution on the 4th beat with a **B♭** in the right hand (MIDI 62)  
  - **Emotion:** Tension, yearning, a whisper of regret  

**Comping:**  
- On the 2nd and 4th beats, Diane plays these chords with a slightly dissonant, angular touch — like the first crack in a mirror.

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass – Walking Line)**  
**Line:**  
- D2 → F2 → A♭2 → C2 → D2  
  - D2 (38) – F2 (41) – A♭2 (44) – C2 (45) – D2 (38)  
- Chromatic approach: On the downbeat of bar 3, Marcus plays a **C♯2** (MIDI 46) before resolving to D2  
- The line moves like a slow, deliberate step toward something — not resolution, but revelation  

**Feel:**  
His bass is the heartbeat of the room. It’s not just keeping time — it’s moving the air.

### **Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax – Melody)**  
**Motif:**  
- **Dm7♭5**  
- Play:  
  - **D (MIDI 62)** – on beat 1  
  - **F (MIDI 65)** – on beat 2  
  - **A♭ (MIDI 67)** – on "and" of 3  
  - **C (MIDI 60)** – on beat 4  

**Phrasing:**  
- Start strong on D, then allow the F to hang — a question.  
- The A♭ is a breath, a hesitation, a pause in the story.  
- End on C, but not with a full note — a short, clipped tone, like a sentence left hanging.  

**Emotion:**  
It's not about the notes — it’s about *what comes next*. You leave the room wanting to know what happens after that last note. That’s the hook. That’s the story. That’s the moment Wayne Shorter leans forward.

### **Conclusion**  
This is the opening of a journey. It doesn’t tell you where it’s going — it asks you to come along. It’s not a song. It’s a beginning. And if you listen closely, it’s the sound of a man who’s heard everything and still has something to say.
