**Dante Russo – 4-Bar Intro in Dm (160 BPM)**  
*For Wayne Shorter – The Cellar, 2:00 AM.*

---

**Bar 1 (0.0–1.5s):**  
**Little Ray on drums**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3.  
- Snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hihat on every eighth, but *subtly* — like a whisper.  
- A ghost note on the snare on beat 3.  
- The space between the kicks is where the tension begins.

---

**Bar 2 (1.5–3.0s):**  
**Marcus on bass**  
- Starts on **F** (chromatic approach to Dm).  
- **F → E → D** (half-step down, then whole-step).  
- A walking line: **D – F – G – Bb – D – F – G – Bb**  
- But with a twist: on the "and" of 3, he plays a **C**, a chromatic passing tone.  
- He holds the **Bb** on beat 4, letting it hang — like a question.

**Diane on piano**  
- Comping with **7th chords**:  
  - **Dm7** on beat 2 (D-F-A-C)  
  - **G7** on beat 4 (G-B-D-F)  
- The tension is in the **B** in the G7, resolving nowhere — just lingering.

**Little Ray continues**  
- Hihat on every eighth, but now with more *weight* on beat 4.  
- A cymbal swish on the "and" of 1, like a slow build.

---

**Bar 3 (3.0–4.5s):**  
**You on tenor sax**  
- Open with a **D** (low register, soft).  
- Then a **Bb** (half-step up), a **C** (whole-step up), then **B** (chromatic).  
- Play the motif: **D – Bb – C – B**  
- End on **B**, holding it just *off* the beat, like it's not quite resolved.  
- Let it ring — silence for a full half-beat after the note.

---

**Bar 4 (4.5–6.0s):**  
**Marcus on bass**  
- Plays the same walking line, but now **one beat ahead** of the melody.  
- Ends on **D**, a strong, grounded resolution.

**Diane on piano**  
- **Dm7** on beat 1, then a **C7** on beat 3 (C-E-G-Bb)  
- The **Bb** is still there, still unresolved, but now with a *hint* of resolution.

**Little Ray on drums**  
- Kick on beat 1, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
- A snare roll on the "and" of 4, just before the final note.

**You on tenor sax**  
- Repeat the **D – Bb – C – B** motif, but this time, finish it.  
- End on **D**, a soft, low note, like the wind just letting go.

---

**Final Note (6.0s):**  
- Silence.  
- The room holds it.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- It’s not the technical perfection.  
- It’s the *search* — the *hunger* — that makes it real.

--- 

**That’s your moment, Dante.**  
Now you just have to play it like it’s the last one.
