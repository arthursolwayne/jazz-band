**Key: Dm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Feel:** Tight, precise, but with a ghost on the "and" of 2 and 4  
**Story:** Silence before the storm. The beat is there, but it’s holding back, like the edge of a shadow. The tension is built not in the sound, but in the *anticipation* of it.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

#### **Marcus (Bass):**
**Notes:** Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
**Line:**  
- D → F (chromatic descent)  
- A → C (chromatic descent)  
- D → F → A → C (chromatic walk up)  
**Rhythm:** Quarter notes, walking with a soulful, bittersweet groove  
**Story:** The anchor. The foundation. The bass is moving like a slow burn, like memory returning.

#### **Diane (Piano):**
**Chords:**  
- Dm7 on beat 1  
- F7 on beat 2  
- A7 on beat 3  
- Cm7 on beat 4  
**Comping:** Offbeats only, with sharp, angry voicings. No fills, just the chords.  
**Story:** Diane is not playing the melody — she’s *painting the mood*. Each chord is a brushstroke of frustration, of longing, of something unresolved.

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax):**
**Line:**  
- Bar 2, beat 1: D  
- Bar 2, beat 2: F  
- Bar 2, beat 3: A  
- Bar 2, beat 4: C  
**Phrasing:** Long, mournful, like a breath held in the dark.  
**Story:** This is the question. The first note is a whisper. It’s not a cry, not a scream — it’s a question. What happens next?

### **Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**
**Line:**  
- Bar 3, beat 1: C  
- Bar 3, beat 2: Bb  
- Bar 3, beat 3: A  
- Bar 3, beat 4: D  
**Phrasing:** A slight upward motion, like a step toward clarity.  
**Story:** The answer is not here yet. But the sax is reaching, moving, searching. It’s not a scale run — it’s an idea, a thought, a feeling.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble:**

#### **Marcus (Bass):**
- Repeat the same Dm7 chromatic walk, but now with a slight push forward  
**Story:** The foundation is steady, but now it’s *driving* toward something.

#### **Diane (Piano):**
- Dm7 on beat 1  
- F7 on beat 2  
- A7 on beat 3  
- Cm7 on beat 4  
**Same chords, but with more aggression in the voicings**  
**Story:** The anger has sharpened. It’s no longer just background — it’s the undercurrent, the tension that wants to break free.

#### **Little Ray (Drums):**
- Kick: 1 and 3  
- Snare: 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat: eighth notes  
**Fill:** A quick, sharp snare hit on the "and" of 3  
**Story:** The energy is rising. The beat is no longer holding back — it’s pushing the melody forward.

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax):**
**Line:**  
- Bar 4, beat 1: D  
- Bar 4, beat 2: F  
- Bar 4, beat 3: A  
- Bar 4, beat 4: D  
**Phrasing:** The same opening motif, but now resolved — a return to the question, but with a hint of understanding  
**Story:** It’s not the answer, but it’s the beginning of something. A story that’s just starting to unfold.

### **Final Story Moment:**
The four bars are not just a melody — they are a moment. A question in the dark. A whisper that carries weight. A sax line that dares to be simple, but dares even more to be true.

And in the back of the room, Wayne Shorter leans forward.

**He hears it.**
