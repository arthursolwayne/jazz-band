  "rationale": "The arrangement lacks essential jazz harmony elements, relying on basic triads in the piano and bass without 7th chords or extensions. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat patterns that emphasize downbeats rather than upbeats, failing to create a Latin jazz feel. The saxophone melody has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The trumpet is entirely silent, and there is no call-and-response between instruments, resulting in a very static and academic feel that does not sound like authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz harmony",
    "Introduce chromatic approach notes and enclosures in the saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Revise the hihat pattern to emphasize upbeat syncopation for a Latin jazz groove",
    "Add walking bass lines with roots, 3rds, 5ths, and 7ths instead of just root notes",
    "Incorporate call-and-response between the saxophone and trumpet for better interplay"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Mandate the use of 7th chords in the piano and bass, emphasize chromatic approach notes in horn lines, and require upbeat syncopation in the hihat pattern. Include examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns to ensure the arrangement meets jazz standards."
