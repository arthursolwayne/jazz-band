### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth, kick on 1 and 3.*  
- Snare: **2 & 4**  
- Hihat: **1 & 2 & 3 & 4**  
- Kick: **1 & 3**  
- *Subtle rimshots at the end of the bar, a whisper of tension.*

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic walk-up from **Eb** to **F** (beat 1):  
  **Eb – D – C# – D – Eb – F**  
- Then a **chromatic approach to Bb** on beat 2:  
  **Bb – A – Ab – Bb**  
- On beat 3: **Ab**  
- On beat 4: **F** (resolve to the root of Fm7)  
- *He’s the anchor, but he’s pulling you in.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - **Beat 2:** Bb7 (Bb – D – F – Ab)  
  - **Beat 4:** Fm7 (F – Ab – Bb – D)  
- *Her chords are sharp, almost aggressive, but she’s not in your way — she’s opening the door.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Play this short motif over the first four beats:  
  **F – Ab – Bb – (space)**  
  *Short, sharp, with a slight rubato on the third note (Bb), like you're about to say something but hold back.*  
- **End on a rest.**  
- *Don’t rush. Make it feel like a question, like you're waiting for the answer.*

### **Bar 3 – Continuation**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic walk-up from **F** to **G** (beat 1):  
  **F – E – D – E – F – G**  
- Then a **chromatic approach to Ab** on beat 2:  
  **Ab – G – Gb – Ab**  
- On beat 3: **G**  
- On beat 4: **F** (again, root of Fm7)  
- *He’s not just walking — he’s leading you.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 3:**  
  - **Beat 2:** Ab7 (Ab – C – Eb – Gb)  
  - **Beat 4:** Fm7 (F – Ab – Bb – D)  
- *She’s pushing you forward, but not overpowering. Her ears are sharp, she knows what you're trying to say.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Repeat the same motif, but now with a little more weight:  
  **F – Ab – Bb – (space)**  
  *This time, the space feels different — it’s not a question anymore. It’s a promise.*

### **Bar 4 – Resolution (and a hook that lingers)**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic walk-up from **F** to **G** (beat 1):  
  **F – E – D – E – F – G**  
- Then a **chromatic approach to Bb** on beat 2:  
  **Bb – A – Ab – Bb**  
- On beat 3: **Ab**  
- On beat 4: **F** (resolve to the root of Fm7)  
- *Same walk, but now it feels like a return — like you're coming home.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 4:**  
  - **Beat 2:** Bb7 (Bb – D – F – Ab)  
  - **Beat 4:** Fm7 (F – Ab – Bb – D)  
- *She’s holding the space now. Letting the harmony breathe, but not letting it end.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **F – Ab – Bb – F**  
  *This time, you finish it. The motif returns, completed — not as a statement, but as a whisper of something new. Something real. Something that could be the start of a song that hasn’t been written yet.*

**Final Note:**  
The intro ends with a **F** on the sax, and a **F** on the piano, and a **F** on the bass.  
The room is quiet.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
You didn’t play a lick of what he expected.  
But he’s listening.
