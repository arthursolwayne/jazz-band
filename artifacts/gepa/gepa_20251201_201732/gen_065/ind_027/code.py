---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick:** 1, 3  
**Snare:** 2, 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (but with subtle dynamic variation – soft on 1, growing into 4)  
**Feel:** A whisper of tension, like a door creaking open. The hihat swells as if the room itself is listening.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Fm7 (F, Ab, Bb, Db)** – Root on beat 1, fifth on beat 2, chromatic approach (Eb) on beat 3, back to root on beat 4.  
- **MIDI:** F2 (38), Bb2 (46), Eb2 (43), F2 (38)

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chord:** G7♭9 (G, B, D, F, Ab)  
- **Voicing:** Open, spaced out – G in the left hand, B and Ab in the right. Let the chord ring on beat 2, resolve gently on beat 4.  
- **Comping:** Enter on beat 2, space on beat 1 – let the silence speak.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif (Fm scale-based, but with space):**  
  - **Bar 2:** F – Ab – (rest) – Bb  
  - **Phrasing:** Start on beat 2, end on beat 4 with a breath-like rest.  
  - **Feel:** A question. A voice in the dark.

### **Bar 3**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Fm7 (F, Ab, Bb, Db)** again, but with a chromatic approach on the third beat (Bb → B)  
- **MIDI:** F2, Bb2, B2, F2

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chord:** Cm7♭5 (C, Eb, Gb, Bb)  
- **Voicing:** C in left hand, Eb and Bb in right. Let it breathe – a moment of tension, unresolved.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif (continuation):**  
  - **Bar 3:** Bb – (rest) – F – (rest)  
  - **Feel:** The answer is just out of reach. The silence is louder than the notes.

---

### **Bar 4**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Fm7 again**, but with a subtle shift – Ab on beat 3, leading into the final chord  
- **MIDI:** F2, Ab2, Bb2, F2

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chord:** Fm7 (F, Ab, Bb, Db)  
- **Voicing:** Full, rich, resolving.  
- **Comping:** Enter on beat 2, peak on beat 4. A moment that feels like home.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif (resolution):**  
  - **Bar 4:** F – Ab – (rest) – Bb  
  - **Feel:** The question is answered, but not with a shout – with a sigh.  
  - **Ends with a breathy Bb, like a whisper in the dark that now feels like a memory.**

### Final Feel:  
The first bar is a hush – the room holds its breath.  
Then, a slow unveiling, like a story being told in the dark, with only the notes and the silence.  
Marcus grounds it. Diane colors it. Ray pushes it.  
And you – you ask the question that Wayne Shorter has been waiting to hear.  

It’s not about the answer.  
It’s about the space between the notes.  
The way the music searches, and then finds itself.  

And in that moment, you feel him lean forward.
