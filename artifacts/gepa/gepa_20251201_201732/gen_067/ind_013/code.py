---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On beats 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Fill:** A subtle, open-ended snare roll on beat 4, fading into silence — like a breath held.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass) & Diane (Piano)**  
**Marcus (Bass, D2-G2, MIDI 38-43):**  
- Root: F  
- Chromatic approach: E (beat 1), F (beat 2)  
- Root: F  
- Chromatic approach: E (beat 3), F (beat 4)  
> Walking line: **E – F – E – F** — tension on the E, resolution on F. No scales, just the edge of something.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Bar 2: **Ebm7 (E♭–G–B♭–D♭)** — open voicing, resolved at the end on the E♭.  
- Comp on beats 2 and 4  
> A chord that doesn’t quite sit — like a memory that won’t stay.

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass) & Diane (Piano)**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Root: Cm (C)  
- Chromatic approach: B (beat 1), C (beat 2)  
- Root: Cm (C)  
- Chromatic approach: B (beat 3), C (beat 4)  
> Subtle shift into the Cm, a color that doesn’t belong — a contrast to the Fm.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Bar 3: **Gm7♭5 (G–B♭–D♭–F)** — dissonant, unresolved, full of tension.  
- Comp on beats 2 and 4  
> A chord that whispers, “What if?”

---

### **Bar 4 – Everyone in: Marcus, Diane, Little Ray, and You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Root: Fm (F)  
- Chromatic approach: E (beat 1), F (beat 2)  
- Root: Fm (F)  
- Chromatic approach: E (beat 3), F (beat 4)  
> Anchor back to Fm, but with a lingering E, like a door left slightly ajar.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Bar 4: **Fm7 (F–A♭–C–E♭)** — open voicing, rich and full, the first chord that resolves.  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4  
> The first real resolution, but not the end — just the beginning.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth  
- Fill: A quick, sharp cymbal on beat 4, like a heartbeat.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Motif:  
  - Bar 4: **F – G♭ – E♭ – E**  
  - Play the first note (F), leave it hanging, build tension with the G♭ and E♭, then resolve with an E — not the F.  
  - Leave it unfinished. Let it breathe.  
  - It’s a question. Not an answer.  
  - The kind of question Wayne Shorter listens for.

### **Final Listen (Mental Picture):**  
A room that’s been waiting. A story that begins with a heartbeat, a question, and a note that doesn’t answer — just asks again.  
No scales, no show-off licks. Just the weight of something real.  
You lean into the silence after that last note, and you wait.  
And in that silence, you feel him — Wayne — lean forward.
