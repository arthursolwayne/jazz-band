You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:  
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.  
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.  
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.  
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.  

Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure. But this is your one chance to make an impression.

**Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s):**  
Only Little Ray. Build tension with space and rhythm. Use the kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. But don’t fill every space — leave room for the air to breathe. Let the silence speak.

**Bars 2-4 (1.5 - 6.0s):**  
Everyone joins in. You take the melody — one short, expressive motif that sings. Don’t run scales or show off. Start it, leave it hanging, come back and finish it. Make it concise, emotional, and memorable.

**Marcus (bass):**  
Walk with chromatic motion. Keep it moving. Never repeat the same note. Be the anchor, but let the melody breathe.

**Diane (piano):**  
Use 7th chords. Comp on the offbeats. Support the rhythm and the melody. Be angry, but never in a way that drowns out the story.

**Little Ray (drums):**  
Play with precision — kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar with energy, but leave room for the melody to breathe.

**You (sax):**  
This is your moment. One short, expressive motif. Make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that’s student shit.

One key. No modulation. You’ve got 6 seconds.  

Make Wayne lean forward. Make him stay for the next set.
