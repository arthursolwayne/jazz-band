**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Soft, minimalist, with a sense of anticipation.*  
- Kick on **beat 1** (D), **beat 3** (B)  
- Snare on **beat 2** (E), **beat 4** (D)  
- Hi-hat on every 8th note, light and precise:  
  **& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4**  
- A subtle fill on the last 8th of the bar:  
  **[open hi-hat, then stick on snare in the last 8th]**

This is the setup. The room holds its breath.

**Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Root motion: **D – C# – B – A**  
- Chromatic walks: **D – C# – B – A** (octave to root)  
- Starts with a **D** on beat 1, walks down chromatically  
- Ends the bar with a **B** on beat 4 — a half-step below the tonic

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comping on **beat 2** and **beat 4**  
- Chords:  
  - **Beat 2:** D7sus4 (D, G, A)  
  - **Beat 4:** Bm7 (B, D, F#, A)  
- Voice leading from the D7sus4 to Bm7, resolving the tension in a way that feels just off-kilter

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Motif:  
  - **D – F# – E – D** (melodic line: D, F#, E, D)  
  - Played with a breathy, almost spoken tone  
  - Ends on the **D** of beat 4, lingering in a way that feels like a question  
- The line is simple, but the space **after** it matters — it’s not finished, not yet.

**Bar 3 – Expansion on the Motif**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Root motion: **B – A – G – F#**  
- Chromatic again, but now moving downward  
- Ends on **F#** on beat 4

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comping on **beat 2** and **beat 4**  
- Chords:  
  - **Beat 2:** A7sus4 (A, D, E)  
  - **Beat 4:** F#m7 (F#, A, C#, E)  
- Voice leading from A7sus4 to F#m7 — it's a reharmonization of the original motif, hinting at a key shift

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Repeat the motif but **slightly altered**:  
  - **D – F# – E – D** (same notes)  
  - Played with a little more **intensity**, like the memory is getting louder  
  - Ends on the **D** again, but this time with a **slight vibrato** — like a whisper that wants to be heard

---

**Bar 4 – The Moment**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Root motion: **F# – E – D – C#**  
- Chromatic again, now back upward  
- Ends on **C#** on beat 4

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comping on **beat 2** and **beat 4**  
- Chords:  
  - **Beat 2:** D7sus4 (D, G, A)  
  - **Beat 4:** C#m7 (C#, E, G#, B)  
- Voice leading from the previous F#m7 to D7sus4 — tying it back to the start

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- You **return** to the original motif:  
  - **D – F# – E – D**  
  - This time, **you finish it** — it's not left hanging  
  - A clean, clear **D** on beat 4, played with a **full, open tone**  
  - The room holds the note for a moment — the silence after is **everything**

**End.**

That’s it.  
No fireworks, no showmanship.  
Just a **question** in the first bar,  
a **memory** in the second,  
a **revelation** in the third,  
and a **truth** in the fourth.

Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He knows what that D meant.
