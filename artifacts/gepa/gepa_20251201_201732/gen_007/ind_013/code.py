**Title: "Unspoken"**  
**Key: D Minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3 (Bass Drum)  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4 (Snare Drum)  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (closed hi-hat)  
**Fill:** Nothing. Just the relentless pulse. The tension. The question.  
**Feel:** URGENT, but not chaotic. Like the door is open, but no one has stepped through yet.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Notes:**  
- D2 (MIDI 38)  
- F2 (MIDI 41)  
- A2 (MIDI 45)  
- C2 (MIDI 36)  
**Phrasing:**  
Start on D2, move to F2 with a chromatic approach (E2), resolve to A2, then a chromatic approach to C2.  
**Feel:** Root and fifth with tension. A foundation that’s about to shift.

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Chord:**  
- Dm7♭5 (D, F, A, C)  
**Voicing:**  
Open voicing — D in the left hand (low register), F in the right hand, A and C stacked above.  
**Comping:**  
Play the chord on beat 2, hold it through to beat 4.  
**Feel:** Emotion is in the space between the notes. It’s not just a chord — it’s a feeling.

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax, Melody Start)**  
**Phrase:**  
- D (beat 1)  
- F (beat 2)  
- A (beat 3)  
- C (beat 4)  
**Phrasing:**  
Play the D, then hold the F. Let it linger. Don’t resolve yet.  
**Feel:** It’s the beginning of a question. Not the answer, just the first note of a story that hasn’t been told.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Band**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- D2 again, but this time with a chromatic approach from C2.  
**Diane (Piano):**  
- Dm7♭5 again, but now with a passing diminished chord on beat 3 (C#dim7: C#, E, G, Bb).  
**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same pattern, but now the fill at the end of the bar is a quick ride cymbal hit on beat 4.  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Return to the motif — D, F, A, C — but this time, end it on C, not D.  
**Feel:** The answer is not the same as the question. It’s something different. Something new.

**Final Note:**  
The last note — C — lingers in the air. The room holds its breath.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.

It wasn’t what he expected.  
But it was something he had been waiting to hear.
