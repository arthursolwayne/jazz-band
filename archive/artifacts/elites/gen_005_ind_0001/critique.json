  "rationale": "This 8-bar arrangement uses only triads (capped jazz_harmony at 3/10) with no 7th chords or functional progressions. The hihat plays on every beat with no upbeat syncopation (capped latin_jazz_rhythm at 3/10), making it sound like straight-time swing rather than Latin jazz. The saxophone melody uses a repetitive scalar pattern (D-F-G) with minimal variation (jazz_melody 4/10) and lacks blues inflections or bebop vocabulary. All instruments start together in bar 1 with no progressive build (interplay_space capped at 4/10). The arrangement feels academic and stiff, lacking the spontaneity and soul of authentic jazz (jazz_authenticity 5/10). Needs 7th chords, stronger upbeat groove, melodic development, and a structured arrangement with space and build.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Bar 1: ONLY hihat should play. All other instruments rest.",
    "Bars 2-4: Add snare and bass. Piano and sax still rest.",
    "Bars 5-8: Full ensemble enters with piano 7th chords and memorable sax melody.",
    "Replace ALL piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7: C-E-G-B, Dm7: D-F-A-C)",
    "Increase hihat upbeat syncopation to >60% (hit more 'and's, skip more downbeats)",
    "In bar 2, replace the D-F-G pattern with a blues-inflected phrase like D-F-Eb-G."
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize progressive arrangement structure more strongly. Add quantitative requirements: Bar 1 = hihat ONLY, Bars 2-4 = rhythm section ONLY (no piano/sax), Bars 5-8 = full ensemble. Make it impossible to ignore. Require 7th chords in piano and saxophone parts. Specify that hihat must have >60% upbeat syncopation. Add a requirement for melodic development with blues inflections and bebop vocabulary."
