**"Story in the First Four" — 4 bars in F, 160 BPM**

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
Start with a tight, urgent shuffle — not swing, not straight, but something *off*.  
Let the cymbal ride build tension.  
*Open with a fill on the 3rd beat, a quick ghost note on 2, then a sharp snare on 4. It’s like a door creaking open before the music begins.*

---

**Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line in F minor, chromatic approach to the 3rd.  
F – Gb – G – Ab – A – Bb – B – C – D – Eb – E – F  
*He plays the line with a low, growling tone, as if he’s speaking in a language only the dead understand.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4 with 7th chords.  
Bar 2: F7 on 2, Bb7 on 4  
She plays *under* the melody, never stepping on your line, but always pushing it forward — like a shadow with a heartbeat.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Motif:  
**F – G – Ab – Bb**  
*Short, sharp, descending. A question. A memory. A door that won’t shut.*  
You play it on the first two beats, then hold the Bb on beat 3, letting it hang — like a silence that’s not silence.

---

**Bar 3 – Develop the Motif**

**Marcus:**  
Continues walking, now with a chromatic approach to the 7th.  
F – Gb – G – Ab – A – Bb – B – C – D – Eb – F  
He’s weaving a path, not a line.

**Diane:**  
Comp again on 2 and 4: F7 on 2, Eb7 on 4  
She’s pushing you now, a bit more aggressive — like she knows what’s coming.

**Little Ray:**  
Fills on 3, a quick ride cymbal roll, then a double snare on 4.

**You:**  
Return to the motif, but shift it up a half step — **G – A – Bb – C**  
Same shape, different key. It’s like the same story, told in a new voice.  
You play it on the first two beats again, this time with a little *bite* — like you're saying something new.

---

**Bar 4 – Resolution (or not)**

**Marcus:**  
Walks to the top of the bar with a chromatic run to the 3rd, then resolves.  
F – Gb – G – Ab – A – Bb – B – C  
He ends with a low F, a grounding note.

**Diane:**  
Comp on beat 2: F7, beat 4: C7  
She’s setting up a possible key change, but doesn’t take it. She leaves it *open*.

**Little Ray:**  
Final fill — a quick roll on the hihat, snare on 4, a ghost note on 1.  
He’s done, but the energy is still in the air.

**You:**  
Repeat the original motif once more — **F – G – Ab – Bb**  
This time you end *on the Bb*, not resolving.  
You leave it hanging — like the end of a sentence, or the beginning of a new one.

---

**Final Note:**  
You hold that Bb just a beat longer than the rest of the band, letting the room breathe.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He’s heard the story.  
And it’s not the one he expected.
