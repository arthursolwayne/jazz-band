**BAR 1 – LITTLE RAY (DRUMS)**  
*160 BPM, 4/4 time – 6.0 seconds total for 4 bars.*

**Drums (Little Ray):**  
Kick on 1 and 3  
Snare on 2 and 4  
Hi-hat on every eighth note  
*Fill the bar with a driving, but precise rhythm. No flair, just energy. The intro is a heartbeat, not a show.*

*Soft, open, unresolved. A question in the air.*

**Bar 3:**  
**Chord:** Bm7b5 (B D F A)  
*Dark, searching. A shadow passing through the room.*

**Bar 4:**  
**Chord:** Gmaj7 (G B D F#)

**BAR 2–4 – DANTÉ RUSSO (TENOR SAX)**  
*One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it.*

**Motif (Bars 2–4):**

**Bar 2 (start of motif):**  
D4 (first note) – held for 2 beats  
*(Long, open, like a breath. A question.)*  
Then silence – 1 beat of space  
*(The room holds.)*

**Bar 3 (continuation):**  
B4 (second note) – held for 2 beats  
*(A step into the dark.)*  
Then silence again – 1 beat of space  
*(The air thickens.)*

**Bar 4 (resolution):**  
G4 (third note) – held for 2 beats  
*(A door creaks open.)*  
Then silence – 1 beat of space  
*(The moment lingers.)*

**FINISHING THE INTRO:**

You end on G4, suspended in the air. No resolution, just a breath held.  
The room is still.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.

**Key:** D major  
**Time:** 4/4  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Atmosphere:** Urgent but grounded, searching but not lost.

It’s not about showing off. It’s about making someone feel something they didn’t know they needed.
