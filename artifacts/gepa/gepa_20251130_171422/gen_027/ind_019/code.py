    - **Beat 3**: G (a half-step up from Bb, suggesting resolution)

  - *Mood: The audience holds its breath. Wayne Shorter nods slightly.*

### **Final Note (End of Bar 4):**  
- A **long, open silence**—just the sound of the room, the hum of the bulb, and the weight of what was just played.  
- It’s not a resolution. It’s a **door that hasn’t opened yet**.  
- That’s the story you want to tell.  
- That’s the intro.
