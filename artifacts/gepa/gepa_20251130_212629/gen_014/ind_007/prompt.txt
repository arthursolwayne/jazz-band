Create an intro that feels like a whisper before a storm—tense, atmospheric, and full of anticipation. The drums should build quiet momentum, using space and restraint, not volume. The ensemble enters with clarity and purpose, each part knowing exactly where it stands. The saxophone melody should be simple but emotionally charged—something that lingers in the air, with rests that speak as much as the notes. Every note must feel intentional, every rest meaningful. Avoid unnecessary repetition or overplaying. Keep the rhythm tight, the harmony honest, and the space between the notes alive. The music should feel like a question, not an answer—something that makes the listener lean in.
