**Title: "Before the Storm"**  
**Key: F minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Style: Intimate Jazz – Tension and Release**

---

### **Bar 1: Drums (Brushes on Snare, Subtle Hi-Hat)**  
- **Kick:** On beat 1  
- **Snare:** On beat 3, soft and dry  
- **Hi-Hat:** On the "and" of 2 and 4, very light  
- **Cymbal:** A faint ride cymbal on beat 2, then silence on beat 4  
- *The rhythm is sparse, like the edge of a breath before the storm. The silence is louder than the sound.*

---

### **Bar 1: Bass (Walking Line in Fm, never repeating the same note)**  
- **Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb) – Rootless walking bass line:**  
  - F → Gb (Bb) → Ab → A (Bb) → Bb → C → Db (C#) → D (Eb)  
  - *Each note is a question, moving forward but never resolving.*

---

### **Bar 1: Piano (Comping with 7th chords, sparse and intentional)**  
- **Chord Progression:**  
  - **m7** on F (Fm7) – *sustained, open, with space between notes*  
  - **7** on Bb (Bb7) – *a single voicing, left hand only, held just long enough to feel the weight of it*  
  - **m7** on Eb (Eb7) – *chord is there, but not played; only the tension remains*  
  - **m7b5** on Ab (Abm7b5) – *a single note in the left hand, echoing the bass line*

---

### **Bar 1: Saxophone (Motif – Simple, Lyrical, Emotionally Charged)**  
- **Motif (Fm scale, ascending):**  
  - F → Gb → Ab (held)  
  - *A single, longing note on the Ab, then silence on the final beat of the bar*  
  - *This is the moment — the first breath before the storm begins.*

---

### **Bar 2: Drums (Building Slight Tension, Subtle Increase in Pressure)**  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-Hat:** On the "and" of 1, 2, 3, 4  
- **Cymbal:** A soft crash on the final beat of the bar  
- *The pressure is rising, but not yet breaking.*

---

### **Bar 2: Bass (Continuation of Walking Line, with slight rhythmic push)**  
- **Fm7 → Gm7 → Am7 → Bbm7**  
- *The line now has a subtle forward drive, but still never repeats the same note*

---

### **Bar 2: Piano (Comping with the same harmonic motion, but now with a little more color)**  
- **Chord Progression:**  
  - **m7** on F → **7** on G → **m7** on A → **m7** on Bb  
  - *Play each chord with a single note from the chord, leaving space between them — like a heartbeat.*

---

### **Bar 2: Saxophone (Motif Repeated, Slightly Higher in Register, with a Note Held)**  
- **F → Gb → Ab (held, with a slight vibrato)**  
- *The same motif, but now with more emotion, as if the storm is close.*

---

### **Bar 3: Drums (Now with a bit more urgency, but still controlled)**  
- **Kick:** On the downbeats  
- **Snare:** On the upbeats  
- **Hi-Hat:** Sustained, with a slight push  
- **Cymbal:** A soft ping on the last beat  
- *The storm is near — the tension is palpable.*

---

### **Bar 3: Bass (Same walking line, now more urgent, with a slight syncopation)**  
- **F → Gb → Ab → A → Bb → C → Db → D**  
- *The line is still rootless, but now has a forward motion that suggests release.*

---

### **Bar 3: Piano (Chords still sparse, but with a bit more motion and slight dissonance)**  
- **Fm7 → Gm7 → Am7 → Bbm7**  
- *Play each chord with a single sustained note — the same note as the bass, but higher — creating a harmonic dialogue.*

---

### **Bar 3: Saxophone (Motif Once Again, Now with a slight rhythmic variation)**  
- **F → Gb → Ab (held) → then a quick Ab → Gb → F**  
- *A variation on the motif, with a small resolution before the big release.*

---

### **Bar 4: Drums (Final Bar – Tension at the Peak)**  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-Hat:** On the "and" of 1, 2, 3, 4  
- **Cymbal:** A soft crash on the final beat  
- *The storm is here — the silence is about to break.*

---

### **Bar 4: Bass (Walking Line Completes, Ending on a Bb with a slight pull toward the next measure)**  
- **Final note:** Bb (with a slight release, as if holding back the storm)  
- *The tension is there — but still not released.*

---

### **Bar 4: Piano (Comping in Fm7, with a final, lingering note that hovers just before release)**  
- **Fm7 chord, sustained in the left hand, single note in the right hand (Ab)**  
- *A single note that lingers — like a question.*

---

### **Bar 4: Saxophone (Final Note)**  
- **Ab (held) with a long, slow vibrato — then silence**  
- *The storm is coming. The silence speaks.*

---

**End of Bar 4.**  
*The stage is set. The tension is complete. Now, the storm can begin.*
