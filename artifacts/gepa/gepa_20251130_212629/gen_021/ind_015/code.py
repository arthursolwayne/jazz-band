**Title: "Four Doors"**  
*Key: D minor | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time Signature: 4/4*

---

### **Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s):**  
**Drummer (Little Ray):**  
- Kick: 1 & 3  
- Snare: 2 & 4  
- Hi-hat: 8th notes on every beat  
- *Fill the space with a syncopated shuffle, but leave space — a half-beat pause on the "3" before the kick hits. It's subtle, but it makes them lean in.*

---

### **Bar 2 (1.5 - 3.0s):**  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Start the motif on the “&” of 1 — a single, high, descending triplet from **E♭** to **C** to **B♭**.  
- Let it hang. No resolution.  
- The note **B♭** ends on the “&” of 2 — a breath, a question.

**Pianist (Diane):**  
- On the “&” of 2, she plays a **Dm7** (D, F, A, C) in a **left-hand voicing**, right hand playing a **B♭** on the same beat — echoing your last note.  
- Her dissonance is present, but it's a question, not an answer.

**Bassist (Marcus):**  
- Chromatic walk up from **C** → **C#** → **D** → **E♭**, then back to **D** on the “&” of 2.  
- Anchor the tension, but never close it.

---

### **Bar 3 (3.0 - 4.5s):**  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Echo the same motif, but transposed down a 3rd — **B♭** → **G** → **F**.  
- This time, you land the **F** on the “&” of 3 — a little more weight, a bit more resolve.

**Pianist (Diane):**  
- She replies with a **G7♭9** (G, B, D, F, A♭) — her anger sharp, but it’s a **lead**, not a wall.  
- She plays it on the “&” of 3, just as you land your note — a call and response in sound and emotion.

**Drummer (Little Ray):**  
- Fills the space between the phrases with a **brush roll** on the snare, keeping the pulse but never pushing.

---

### **Bar 4 (4.5 - 6.0s):**  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Return to the original motif, but now you finish it.  
- **E♭** → **C** → **B♭** → **A**.  
- Land the **A** on the “&” of 4 — a full resolution, but not a resolution of tension, just of sound.

**Pianist (Diane):**  
- She plays a **A7♭13** (A, C#, E, G, B♭, D) — a dissonant, sophisticated chord, but it’s not about tension anymore — it’s about **color**, and **memory**.

**Bassist (Marcus):**  
- Chromatic walk down from **A** → **G#** → **G** → **F#**, ending on **F#** on the “&” of 4 — a half-step below the final chord, leaving the listener hanging.

**Drummer (Little Ray):**  
- Ends the bar with a **snare hit on 4**, and a **hi-hat on the “&” of 4**, locking the space into the next phrase.

### **Final Moment (6.0s):**  
- Silence.  
- The room holds the sound.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.

**That’s the intro.**  
It doesn’t tell a story — it *invites* one.  
It doesn’t sound like anything else you’ve heard — it sounds like something you *remember* but can’t name.  
And that’s what jazz is.
