Create an intro that feels like a whisper before a storm, with tension and release. The drums should build anticipation, then the ensemble enters with clarity and purpose. The saxophone melody should be simple but emotionally charged — something that lingers in the air. Every note should feel intentional, every rest meaningful. No unnecessary repetition. Keep the rhythm tight, the harmony honest, and the space between the notes alive. The saxophone motif must begin with a question, leave it hanging, and return to answer it. The bass should walk with chromatic tension but never repeat a note. The piano should comp with 7th chords, staying out of the way but driving the rhythm forward. The drums should fill every bar with energy, but not overwhelm the space. The overall feel should be urgent, but restrained — as if the music is holding its breath before the storm.
