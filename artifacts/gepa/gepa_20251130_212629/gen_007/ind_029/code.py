---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray – Drums (Set the mood)**

- **Kick:** On beat 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On beat 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every 8th note  
- **Fill:** On beat 4, a short, brushed cymbal roll (3-4 hits), fading into the silence.

**Purpose:** Build tension, create anticipation. This is the silence before the storm.

---

### **Bar 2: Everyone enters. Diane on piano, Marcus on bass, you on tenor.**

#### **Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Walking line:**  
  - Dm7 → Bb → C → Eb  
  - Chromatic approach to Bb (C, B, Bb)  
  - Then a half-step up to C (chromatic approach)  
  - Ends on Eb (tonic of the key), resolving the tension.

#### **Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4:**  
  - Bar 2, beat 2: Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
  - Bar 2, beat 4: Eb7 (Eb, G, Bb, D)  
  - Keep it sparse, with just the root and 7th, letting space breathe.

#### **You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Melody (Bar 2):**  
  - Start on **D**, a low, brooding note.  
  - Then a **melodic motif:**  
    - **D → Eb → C → B (half-step resolution)**  
  - Let it hang. End on **B**, unresolved, but full of promise.

---

### **Bar 3: You continue the motif, slightly altered.**

- **Melody (Bar 3):**  
  - **B → C → A → G**  
  - A mirror image of the first motif, descending.  
  - Ends on **G**, creating a sense of yearning.

#### **Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Walking line:**  
  - G → F → E → D  
  - Chromatic approach to F (E, F)  
  - Then E → D (chromatic down)  
  - Ends on D again, like a call back to the beginning.

#### **Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4:**  
  - Bar 3, beat 2: Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)  
  - Bar 3, beat 4: A7 (A, C#, E, G)  
  - Subtle movement, not too far from the root, but just enough to push the story forward.

#### **Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Same pattern as Bar 1**, but slightly punchier.  
- The cymbal roll on beat 4 is a little louder, as if the tension is about to break.

---

### **Bar 4: You resolve it — but not completely.**

- **Melody (Bar 4):**  
  - **G → A → D → C**  
  - A final, open-ended phrase.  
  - Ends on **C**, just a half-step below D, leaving the door ajar.  
  - The silence after that note is the final question.

#### **Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Walking line:**  
  - C → B → A → G  
  - Chromatic approach to B (C, B)  
  - Then A → G  
  - Ends on **G**, and holds it, like a breath held in the dark.

#### **Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4:**  
  - Bar 4, beat 2: Am7 (A, C, E, G)  
  - Bar 4, beat 4: B7 (B, D#, F#, A)  
  - The last chord is a **B7**, which is a half-step above the key center, a subtle dissonance that lingers.

#### **Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Same pattern**, but the cymbal roll on beat 4 is softer now, as if the moment is settling.

### **Final Notes:**

You end on **C**, with a slight vibrato and a breathy sound. The room holds.  
Marcus holds the **G** on the bass, like a heartbeat.  
Diane’s **B7** lingers.  
Little Ray’s drums are silent — for a moment.  

And in the back of the room, a man in a dark suit leans forward.  
He’s listening.  
He’s heard something new.  
Something that wants to be heard.

**Wayne leans forward.**
