**Dante Russo — Intro for Wayne**  
**Key: Dm (D minor)**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

**Bar 1 (0.00–1.50s):**  
*Little Ray on drums – a single, resonant kick on beat 1, followed by a ghost note on the snare (beat 2). A light hihat on the "and" of 2, and a dry, low snare on beat 3. Beat 4 is empty. The room holds its breath.*

- **Kick on 1**, **ghost snare on 2**, **hihat on "and" of 2**, **snare on 3**.  
- No cymbals, no fills – just a heartbeat. A pause. A question.

---

**Bar 2 (1.50–3.00s):**  
*Marcus on bass enters with a walking line, starting on D, chromatically descending to C, then resolving to B♭. Diane enters on the 2nd beat with a Dm7 chord (D, F, A, C), played with a sharp attack and a bit of tension in the F.*

- **Marcus:** D – C – B♭ – A (walking line, 4th note rhythm)  
- **Diane:** Dm7 on beat 2, voice leading: D–F–A–C, resolving to C on beat 4.  
- **Little Ray:** Kick on 1, snare on 2, hihat on 3 and 4, hihat on "and" of 3 and 4.  

---

**Bar 3 (3.00–4.50s):**  
*You enter with the melody. A short, soulful motif: D – F – G – B♭, played with a slight rubato, leaning into the B♭. It’s not a scale run – it’s a phrase. A story. A memory.*

- **Tenor sax:** D (beat 1) – F (beat 2) – G (beat 3) – B♭ (beat 4)  
- Play the D slightly behind the beat, the F with a little tension, the G with a breath of release, and the B♭ as a question mark.

**Bar 4 (4.50–6.00s):**  
*Marcus continues walking, Diane adds a Dm7 on beat 2, Little Ray fills the bar with hihat and snare. You leave it open – don’t finish the phrase. Let the B♭ hang in the air. Let it be the silence after the question.*

- **Marcus:** B♭ – A – G – F (walking line, resolving back to D)  
- **Diane:** Dm7 on beat 2, same as bar 2  
- **Little Ray:** Kick on 1, snare on 2, hihat on 3 and 4, hihat on "and" of 3 and 4  
- **You:** Hold the B♭ on beat 4. No resolution. No answer. Just the sound of the room, the weight of the moment, the silence after the question.

**Final Thought:**  
It’s not about what you play — it’s about what you leave out. Wayne leans forward. The room holds its breath. The silence speaks. That’s your shot.
