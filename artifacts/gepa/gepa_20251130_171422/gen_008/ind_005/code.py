**Title: "Montclair Midnight"**  
**Key: Dm (D minor)**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Setting: The Cellar, 2am. Wayne Shorter is in the back.**

---

**Bar 1 (Little Ray – Drums):**  
*Space. Tension. A breath held.*

- Kick on **beat 1**, snare on **beat 3** – *sharp, dry, precise.*
- Hi-hat on **eighth notes** (1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &), *but with a slight delay on beat 1 and 3* – like the sound is just barely catching up to the beat.
- **No cymbal crashes**, no fills. Just the *sound of waiting*.

---

**Bar 2 (Full Quartet):**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Dm7** chord (D F A C)  
- Chromatic line: **D – C – B – A** on beat 1, then **G – F – E – D** on beat 2, resolving to **D** on beat 3.  
- **Walking bass line**: Keep it moving, never the same note twice. Let it feel like a whisper at the bottom of the room.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp with **Dm7** (D F A C) on beat 2 and 4.  
- **Chords**:  
  - **Beat 2**: **Gm7** (G Bb D F) – a chromatic shift with a touch of dissonance.  
  - **Beat 4**: **F7** (F A C E) – a chromatic lead into the next bar.  
- Keep it sparse, harmonic, and *attentive* – like she’s listening to every breath of the room.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on **1 and 3**, snare on **2 and 4**, hihat on every eighth.  
- *But* – on **beat 2**, the hihat is **delayed by 1/16th**, creating a subtle, *spacey* effect.  
- It’s tight, but it feels like it's *just now* hitting.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif**:  
  - **Bar 2, beat 1**: Start on **D**, play a short, *haunting* phrase:  
    **D – F – Eb – D**  
    (half note, quarter note, eighth note, eighth note)  
  - Let it **hang** on the last **D** – a rest on **beat 3**, then a breath on **beat 4**.  
  - *Don’t finish it*. Don’t resolve it. Just make it feel like it came from somewhere else, and it’s *still coming*.

---

**Bar 3 (Full Quartet):**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic line: **A – Bb – B – C** on beat 1  
- Then **D – C – B – A** on beat 2  
- Ends with a **G** on beat 3, leaving the room *anticipating* something.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Dm7** on beat 2, **Bm7** on beat 3, **A7** on beat 4  
- Let the dissonance of **Bm7** linger – it’s a question, not an answer.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Beat 1: Kick, snare, hihat  
- Beat 2: Kick, hihat  
- Beat 3: Kick, hihat  
- Beat 4: Snare, hihat  
- *Tight*, *rhythmically precise*, and *in your face* – but not overwhelming.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Bar 3, beat 1**: Echo the **D – F – Eb – D** motif from Bar 2  
- But this time, go higher:  
  **D – F – Eb – D**  
  **G – A – Bb – A**  
  (One full phrase, like a question being asked again, but with more emotion)  
- End on **A**, a half note – *suspended*, like a memory.

---

**Bar 4 (Full Quartet):**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic line: **A – Bb – B – C** (beat 1)  
- Ends with **C** on beat 4 – *a slight resolution*, but still unresolved.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **C7** on beat 1  
- **Bm7** on beat 2  
- **Am7** on beat 3  
- **A7** on beat 4  
- *It’s a journey*. The chords don’t settle. They move, like thoughts in the dark.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on **1 and 3**, snare on **2 and 4**, hihat on every eighth  
- Let the sound *fill* the room, but *don’t let it rush*.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Bar 4, beat 1**: You return to the **D**  
  Play this final phrase:  
  **D – F – Eb – D**  
  (One last time)  
- Then, a **half rest** on beat 2  
- Then, a **single A** on beat 3  
- Then, **rest** on beat 4  
- *It’s not over. It's just beginning.*

**Final Thought:**  
This is not a song. It's a **moment**.  
It's the sound of a room that’s waiting, of a bass that moves like memory, of a piano that holds anger in its chords, of a drummer who knows how to *hold* the beat but not *own* it.  
And you — you’re the one who’s holding the door open.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He’s listening.  
Because this?  
This is the sound of something new.  
Something that only could have come from now.
