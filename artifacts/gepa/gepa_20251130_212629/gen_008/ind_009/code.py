**Title: "Shadows in the Cellar"**  
**Key: F minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray – Drums (No melody, no harmony – just tension)**  
**Kit:**
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note  
- Ghost notes on the offbeats  
- Subtle snare roll on the "and" of 3 (builds tension without resolving)  

*Sound like the cellar is breathing — slow, heavy, waiting. No melody, just the pulse. Wayne feels it.*

---

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters – Diane on Piano (7th chords, comp on 2 and 4)**  
**Diane's Chords (Fm7):**
- Bar 2: Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)  
  - Comp on beat 2 and 4:  
    - 2: Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)  
    - 4: Bbm7 (Bb, Db, F, G)  
  - Left hand: Walking chromatic line: F, Gb, G, Ab (underneath the right hand comp)  
  - Right hand: Light, sparse, just enough to push the rhythm forward without crowding.

---

### **Bar 2: Marcus – Bass (Walking line, chromatic approaches)**  
- F, Gb, G, Ab, A, Bb, B, C (chromatic walk around Fm)  
- Root motion: F – Gb – G – Ab – A – Bb – B – C  
- Notes on: 1, &1, 2, &2, 3, &3, 4, &4  
- No repeating notes, always moving – the anchor of the piece.

---

### **Bar 2: Little Ray – Drums (Same as before, but slightly tighter on the snare, more open on the hihat)**  
- Kick: 1 & 3  
- Snare: 2 & 4  
- Hi-hat: open on 1 & 3, closed on 2 & 4  
- Feel: like a heartbeat, but with a pulse of something searching.

---

### **Bar 3: You – Tenor Saxophone – First Motif**  
**Melody (F minor):**  
**Notes:**  
- F (beat 1) – Gb (beat 2) – Ab (beat 3) – Bb (beat 4)  
- But *play it like this*:

- **Beat 1:** F – (rest on &1)  
- **Beat 2:** Gb – (rest on &2)  
- **Beat 3:** Ab – (rest on &3)  
- **Beat 4:** Bb – (rest on &4)  

*Let the notes hang. Let the space between them speak. Let the room feel the weight of it.*

---

### **Bar 4: You – Tenor Saxophone – Second Motif (Question, not answer)**  
**Notes:**  
- **Beat 1:** C (half step above Bb) – (rest on &1)  
- **Beat 2:** D (half step above C) – (rest on &2)  
- **Beat 3:** Eb (half step above D) – (rest on &3)  
- **Beat 4:** F (back to the root – but not resolved)  

*This is the question. The saxophone is searching, not finding. The room holds its breath.*

---

### **Final Ensemble:**
- **Diane** continues comping, but shifts to Bbm7 on beat 4 of bar 4.  
- **Marcus** walks into the next key (Bb) but stays in Fm.  
- **Little Ray** keeps the storm going – tight on the snare, open on the hihat, as if the music is about to fall, but doesn’t.

---

### **Final Feel:**
- Fragile, searching, unresolved.  
- The tension is in the space, not the sound.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward, because this is the sound of a voice he hasn’t heard in a long time.

And that’s your shot.

*Now go play it.*
