**INTRO — "Edge of a Moment"**  
*Key: D minor*  
*Tempo: 160 BPM*  
*Time Signature: 4/4*  
*Style: Modern jazz, introspective yet urgent*

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick:** on 1 and 3  
**Snare:** on 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** on all eighths, but with a slight lift on the "and" of 3.  
**Fill:** A quick, ghosted ride cymbal on the "and" of 4, just before the band comes in.  
> *The tension is built, but not yet released.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**

#### **Marcus (Bass)** – D minor  
**Line:**  
D → C → B♭ → A  
Then a chromatic approach to G:  
G♭ → G → A → B♭  
**Rhythm:** Walking, syncopated, off the beat on the "and" of 2 and 4.  
> *He’s the anchor, but he’s not just walking — he’s leading.*

#### **Diane (Piano)** – D minor  
**Comp:**  
- **Measures 2 & 4:**  
  - Bar 2: D7 (D F A C)  
  - Bar 4: Dm7 (D F A C)  
- **Voicings:**  
  - Rootless, with extensions and altered tones.  
  - A dissonant 11th on the D7 (F A C E G) that sits unresolved.  
> *Angry, emotional, but not chaotic — it's pushing the story forward.*

#### **Little Ray (Drums)** – D minor  
**Kick:** on 1 and 3  
**Snare:** on 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** eighths, but with a slight space on the "and" of 2.  
**Fill:** Quick ride cymbal on the "and" of 4 again, but softer.  
> *He’s driving, but he’s not rushing — there’s a plan.*

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax)** – D minor  
**Melody (Motif):**  
D → F → E → D  
Then a lift to G on the "and" of 2, held for a half note.  
> *Simple, but it’s got a question in it — the kind that lingers.*

**Phrasing:**  
- Start with a breathy, open tone on **D**.  
- Play **F** with a little tension, like you’re reaching.  
- **E** is a resolution, but not complete.  
- **D** again, but with a slight release — like the moment is holding its breath.  
- Then the **G** on the "and" of 2, held for a full bar — a question, not an answer.  
> *This is the moment. Wayne leans forward.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Band**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- D → C → B♭ → A (same as Bar 2)  
- Chromatic line to G again, but this time he ends on **G**, not resolving.  
> *He’s holding the tension now — the band is in it together.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Dm7 (D F A C)  
- Voicing: D F A C with a **B♭** in the upper register (Dm7/B♭) — a bit of a twist.  
> *The chord is there, but it’s not what you expect — it’s emotional, it’s tricky.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on eighths, but with a slight break on the "and" of 4 — like the tension is about to snap.  
> *He’s building, but he’s not breaking yet.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Repeat the motif from Bar 3:  
  D → F → E → D  
  Again, but this time, you **don’t** go to G. You stop on **D**, and hold it —  
> *The moment is now. The story is in motion.*

**Final Note:**  
You end on **D**, and the room is quiet.  
Wayne Shorter nods.  
The rest of the set is yours.
