**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Dynamic contrast, tension in the silence.*

- **Kick**: On beat 1 only — deep, resonant, like the first breath of dawn.  
- **Snare**: On beat 2 — sharp, cutting, like a whisper.  
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth note, but with **light, staccato** articulation — *shhh...*  
- **Fill**: On beat 3, a **brushed roll** on the snare, leading into the next bar.  
- **Beat 4**: Nothing. Silence. The room holds its breath.

*Purpose*: A moment of anticipation. The sound is there, but it’s not yet *the song* — it's the moment before the song.

**Bar 2 – Full Ensemble (Marcus, Diane, You):**

- **Marcus (Bass)**:  
  - **Beat 1**: Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb) — low register, root on the downbeat.  
  - **Beat 2**: Chromatic approach to Bb: Ab → Bb.  
  - **Beat 3**: Gb (chromatic approach to Ab).  
  - **Beat 4**: Rootless Fm7 (Ab, C, Eb) — low, smooth, walking.  
  - *Rhythm*: Quarter notes, but with subtle syncopation on the offbeats, like a shadow moving.

- **Diane (Piano)**:  
  - **Beat 2**: F7 (F, A, C, Eb) — accented.  
  - **Beat 4**: Ab7 (Ab, C, Eb, Gb) — darker, more angular.  
  - *Rhythm*: Comp on beats 2 and 4, with a **left-hand walking line** that outlines Fm, but with a touch of dissonance.  
  - *Emotion*: Angry, but controlled. A storm waiting to break.

- **You (Tenor Sax)**:  
  - **Beat 1**: F (low register, soft, like a memory).  
  - **Beat 2**: Ab (chromatic, a question).  
  - **Beat 3**: Rest.  
  - **Beat 4**: Rest again.  
  - *Tone*: Smooth, but with a hint of grit — like a smoke-filled room.

*Purpose*: The melody is introduced — not as a statement, but as a question. A whisper. It lingers in the air, waiting for the next bar.

**Bar 3 – Full Ensemble:**

- **Marcus (Bass)**:  
  - **Beat 1**: Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb) — chromatic approach to C.  
  - **Beat 2**: Bb (chromatic approach to C).  
  - **Beat 3**: A (chromatic approach to Bb).  
  - **Beat 4**: Cm7 again — low, warm, like a sigh.

- **Diane (Piano)**:  
  - **Beat 1**: C7 (C, E, G, Bb) — smooth, but with tension.  
  - **Beat 3**: A7 (A, C#, E, G) — a sudden shift, like a memory resurfacing.  
  - *Rhythm*: Still comping on 2 and 4 — but now the chords are more chromatic, more emotional.

- **You (Tenor Sax)**:  
  - **Beat 1**: C (sung, not played — like a breath).  
  - **Beat 2**: Bb (chromatic, descending).  
  - **Beat 3**: A (rest).  
  - **Beat 4**: Rest again.  
  - *Tone*: More open, more vulnerable. You’re not *saying* it — you’re *feeling* it.

*Purpose*: The melody continues, but now it’s not just a question — it’s a memory. You’re showing the room what it means to be haunted by a sound.

**Bar 4 – Full Ensemble:**

- **Marcus (Bass)**:  
  - **Beat 1**: Fm7 again (F, Ab, C, Eb) — grounding, but with a slight lift.  
  - **Beat 2**: D (chromatic approach to Eb).  
  - **Beat 3**: Eb (chromatic approach to F).  
  - **Beat 4**: Fm7 — back to the original key, but with a new weight.

- **Diane (Piano)**:  
  - **Beat 1**: F7 (F, A, C, Eb) — full, rich, but with a touch of dissonance.  
  - **Beat 3**: E7 (E, G#, B, D) — a moment of tension, like a door closing.  
  - *Rhythm*: Still comping on 2 and 4, but now the chords are more aggressive, more urgent.

- **You (Tenor Sax)**:  
  - **Beat 1**: F (low, strong, like a final word).  
  - **Beat 2**: Ab (chromatic, like a sigh).  
  - **Beat 3**: Rest.  
  - **Beat 4**: Rest.  
  - *Tone*: Soft, but with a presence. You don't play it — you let it hang. Let the room think about it.

*Purpose*: The intro ends not with a resolution, but with a question. You’ve set the tone. You’ve planted the seed. Now, it’s up to the rest of the song — and to Wayne — to decide what comes next.

**Final Note:**

It’s not about showmanship. It’s about *truth*. You’ve given him a moment — a melody that feels like it’s been waiting for him. And in that moment, he leans forward.
