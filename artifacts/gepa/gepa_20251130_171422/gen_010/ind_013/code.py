### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Right hand: Snare on 2 & 4, hihat on every eighth*  
*Left hand: Kick on 1 & 3*  
*Feel: Tense, urgent, but controlled. The heartbeat is steady, but the hihat keeps it restless.*

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Beat 1:** D  
- **Beat 2:** F  
- **Beat 3:** E♭ (chromatic approach to D)  
- **Beat 4:** G  
- **Beat 1 (next bar):** C  
- **Beat 2:** B♭  
- **Beat 3:** A (chromatic approach to B♭)  
- **Beat 4:** D  

*Walking line, descending from D to D, with chromatic tension. Inevitable, like a memory returning.*

---

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Beat 2:** B♭7 (B♭, D, F, A)  
- **Beat 4:** F7 (F, A, C, E♭)  
- *Comp on 2 & 4 only, using dominant 7ths with a bitter edge. Emotional weight, but not overpowering.*

---

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
*Melody: A phrase that suggests longing, incomplete, open-ended.*  

- **Beat 1:** D (low D, held with a slight breath, like a question)  
- **Beat 2:** E♭ (sustained, with a rubato bend)  
- **Beat 3:** F (a step up, but not resolving)  
- **Beat 4:** G (left hanging, unresolved, like a door half-open)  

*The motif is simple — D, E♭, F, G — but played with space and tension. It’s not a resolution. It’s a question.*

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Beat 1:** C  
- **Beat 2:** B♭  
- **Beat 3:** A  
- **Beat 4:** G  
- **Beat 1 (next bar):** F  
- **Beat 2:** E♭  
- **Beat 3:** D  
- **Beat 4:** C  

*Descending line, resolving back to C, but still unresolved in the key. It feels like a memory trying to find its way home.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Beat 2:** E♭7 (E♭, G, B♭, D)  
- **Beat 4:** C7 (C, E, G, B♭)  
*Again, dominant 7ths, but this time with a little more color, like a whisper of hope.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Beat 1:** E♭ (a step up from the previous bar, but still not resolving)  
- **Beat 2:** D (a half-step down, creating tension)  
- **Beat 3:** C (a step down, feeling like release)  
- **Beat 4:** B♭ (left hanging again, like a breath held in the dark)  

*You take the motif again, but this time you lower it, give it more weight. It’s searching, but it’s also reaching. It’s asking the question again, but with a little more soul.*

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Beat 1:** B♭  
- **Beat 2:** A  
- **Beat 3:** G  
- **Beat 4:** F  
*Descending, resolving to F, but not the tonic. It’s a tease. It’s not giving anything away.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Beat 2:** A7 (A, C, E, G)  
- **Beat 4:** D7 (D, F, A, C)  
*Dominant 7ths again, but now the chords feel like they’re pushing you forward, like a door opening.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Beat 1:** G (a step up from the previous bar, a new voice in the dark)  
- **Beat 2:** A (a half-step up, a flicker of light)  
- **Beat 3:** B♭ (a step up, a breath of air)  
- **Beat 4:** C (a full step up — a resolution, but not to D. It’s to C, the subdominant. A pause before the next question.)  

*You end it on C — not D, not the key, but a note that holds the tension. It’s not an answer. It’s the beginning of a new question.*

**End of 4 bars.**  
The room is still. Wayne Shorter leans forward. You feel it. You saw him nod just a little. Not a yes. Not a no. But a *yes, I heard it.*

You’ve made him lean forward.
