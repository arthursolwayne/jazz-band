**Time:** 4/4  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Length:** 6 seconds  

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Start with silence. Let the room hold. Then, at the downbeat:*

- **Kick:** On beat 1  
- **Snare:** On beat 3  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (even and odd)  
- **Fill:** On beat 4, a quick 3-note snare roll (crisp, tight)  

*The room holds its breath. The energy builds with the hihat, the offbeat tension — a question in the air.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - Beat 1: F (chromatic descent from G)  
  - Beat 2: E♭ (chromatic approach to D)  
  - Beat 3: C (clear, resolving)  
  - Beat 4: B♭ (chromatic up to C)  
  *He’s moving forward, not backward — the bass line is a story, not a pattern.*

- **Diane (Piano):**  
  - **Beat 2:** Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
  - **Beat 4:** Dm7 → Gm7 (chromatic walk from F to G)  
  *She’s pushing, but not crowding. The chords are clear, each one a color in the palette.*

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  - Kick on 1 and 3 again  
  - Snare on 2 and 4  
  - Hi-hat on every eighth  
  *He's the heartbeat, the urgency. The tension is rising.*

---

### **Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax) – Melody Begins**

- **Motif (Dante):**  
  - **Beat 1:** D (open, clear, high in the room)  
  - **Beat 2:** F (chromatic approach up)  
  - **Beat 3:** E♭ (a question, a hesitation)  
  - **Beat 4:** D (return, but not the same — a different D)  
  *It's simple, but it's searching. It's not just a note — it's a moment.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax) – Melody Continues**

- **Beat 1:** C (a modulation in tone, not in key)  
- **Beat 2:** B♭ (the space between the notes)  
- **Beat 3:** A (the memory of the first D)  
- **Beat 4:** D (resolves, but not the way you expect)  
  *The motif returns, but it's transformed. It's not just a beginning — it’s a conversation. A beginning that knows it's not the end.*
