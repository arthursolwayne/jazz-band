**Four Bars in Fm — The Intro That Makes Wayne Sit Up**  
*Key: F minor | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time Signature: 4/4*  

---

**Bar 1 — Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Space. Air. A heartbeat.*  

- **Kick**: On 1 and 3 — deep, resonant, like a memory brushing against the wall.  
- **Snare**: On 2 and 4 — sharp, crisp, like a door closing.  
- **Hi-Hat**: On every eighth note — but soft, like breath.  
- **Cymbal**: A crash on the “&” of 3 — just once. A whisper of danger.  

*Let the silence speak. Make the room feel the weight of what’s coming.*

**Bar 2 — Full Ensemble Enters**  

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Start with a short, haunting phrase — a single motif, not a run.  
**Notes (Fm7 voicing):**  
F, Ab, D, Eb  
Play the F on beat 1, Ab on “&” of 1, D on beat 2, and Eb on “&” of 2.  
Then **leave it hanging** — don’t resolve. Let the silence scream.

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- D2 (Fm root), then chromatic approach: Eb2, D2  
- Then G2 (Fm5), then Ab2 (chromatic)  
- Then back to D2 again — a walking line that feels like a question.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Bar 2: Fm7 (F, Ab, D, Eb) — open voicing, left hand on D2, right hand on F and Ab  
- Bar 3: Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab) — tension, unresolved  
- Bar 4: Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F) — resolve, but not totally — still a question

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3 — steady but not oppressive  
- Snare on 2 and 4 — sharp, like a knife  
- Hi-hat on every eighth — but not too loud — let the silence speak

---

**Bar 3 — You (Tenor Sax) Return**  
Play the same motif again — F, Ab, D, Eb — but with a little more **bite**, a little more **edge**.  
Let it hang again. Let the silence grow.

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic line: G2, Ab2, Bb2, A2, G2  
- Then back to D2 again — still walking, still questioning

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Bar 3: Bb7 — with a tritone substitution (E7) in the left hand  
- Tension, anger — that’s her  
- She plays like she’s burning something down, but she’s holding it in

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- A fill on the “&” of 2 — quick, sharp, like a flick of the wrist  
- Let the energy climb, but keep the space

**Bar 4 — Resolution? No. Just a Question.**  

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
End the motif — this time, **finish it**.  
Play the F again, but this time **hold it** — a long, dark, resonant note.  
Let it echo. Let it linger.  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- D2 — a single note, long, grounded  
- Like the earth holding its breath after a storm

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Gm7 — resolve, but with a **twist**  
- Left hand: G2, right hand: Bb, D, F — open, but **suspenseful**

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Snare on 4 — a final crash  
- Cymbal on 4 — a whisper  
- Then, silence. A long, deep silence.
