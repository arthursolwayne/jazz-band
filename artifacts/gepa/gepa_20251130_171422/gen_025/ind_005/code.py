---

### **BAR 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*(Rest until the last eighth note of the bar, then a sharp, staccato hit on the snare at beat 3, followed by a ghost note on the kick at beat 4. The hihat is present but barely there — a whisper of tension.)*

**Progression:**  
- **Beat 1:** Rest  
- **Beat 2:** Rest  
- **Beat 3:** Snare (staccato, high on the drum head)  
- **Beat 4:** Kick (ghosted, low, barely felt)  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth, but very soft, almost like a breath.

*The room holds its breath.*

### **BAR 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Beat 1:** F – Gb (chromatic approach to F)  
- **Beat 2:** Ab – A (chromatic approach to Bb)  
- **Beat 3:** Bb – A (chromatic approach to Ab)  
- **Beat 4:** C – B (chromatic approach to C)  
*(walking line, no repetition, each note a question, each interval a hesitation.)*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Beat 2:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
- **Beat 4:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
*(7th chords on 2 and 4, sparse but full of dissonance.)*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth, crisp and urgent.  
*(Filling the space with motion but not noise.)*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (soft, breathy, held just a hair over the beat)  
- **Beat 2:** Rest  
- **Beat 3:** Ab (half note, full-bodied, slightly behind the beat)  
- **Beat 4:** Rest  
*(A single phrase, two notes, two rests. A question with no answer yet.)*

### **BAR 3 – Collective Build**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Beat 1:** Eb – D (chromatic approach to C)  
- **Beat 2:** C – B (chromatic approach to Bb)

*(Still walking, still searching.)*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Beat 2:** G7 (G, B, D, F)  
- **Beat 4:** C7 (C, E, G, Bb)  
*(A pivot — from Bb7 to C7. A subtle shift in key center.)*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick:** 1 and 3, slightly accented  
- **Snare:** 2 and 4, with a slight rimshot on beat 4  
- **Hi-hat:** Still present, but with a bit more drive.  
*(Building momentum, but not yet breaking.)*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Beat 1:** Rest  
- **Beat 2:** Bb (sustained, growling slightly, slightly behind the beat)  
- **Beat 3:** Rest

*(Now the silence speaks louder. The answer is not yet here. The tension is thick.)*

- **Beat 1:** F – Gb (chromatic approach to F)  
- **Beat 2:** A – Bb (chromatic approach to Bb)  
- **Beat 3:** C – B (chromatic approach to C)  
- **Beat 4:** D – C (chromatic approach to C)  
*(Back to the beginning, but with a new urgency.)*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Beat 2:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
- **Beat 4:** D7 (D, F#, A, C)  
*(A pivot to D7. The tension is resolved, but not the way you expect.)*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick:** 1 and 3, now with a slight crescendo  
- **Snare:** 2 and 4, with a sharp rimshot on beat 4  
- **Hi-hat:** Still on every eighth, but now with more weight.  
*(The energy is rising. The room is alive.)*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (same as the first bar, but now with more confidence, slightly louder)  
- **Beat 2:** Rest  
- **Beat 3:** Ab (same as before, but now with a touch of growl, like a memory)  
- **Beat 4:** C (a half step above the Ab, a resolution — but not a conclusion)  
*(The melody returns, but now it’s not a question. It’s a memory. A feeling. A door that’s just opened.)*

**End of Intro.**  
Wayne Shorter leans forward. The room holds its breath.  
This is the beginning of something that will haunt him long after the last note.
