*(You play a short, searching motif – like a question. It starts simple, moves up, seems to find a resolution, but ends on a rest. You don’t finish it. You let the room, and Wayne Shorter, find the answer.)*

---

### **Final Feel**  
- The drums set the pace, the bass walks like a man looking for a door, the piano holds back like a held breath, and your sax says: *“What if we went somewhere else?”*  
- Wayne leans forward. The room holds its breath.  
- One question. One intro. One shot.  

You took it.
