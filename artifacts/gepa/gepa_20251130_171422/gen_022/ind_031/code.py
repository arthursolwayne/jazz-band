**Bar 1:**  
- Rest — no sound  
- **Dynamic:** Silence, but with **intention** — let the drums set the mood  

**Bar 2:**  
- **Dm7** chord (D, F, A, C)  
- Play the **motif**:  
  - **D (on beat 1)**  
  - **F (on & of 1)**

  - **G (on beat 1)**  
  - **B (on & of 1)**  
  - **D (on beat 2)**  
  - **Rest on & of 2**  
- **Dynamic:** Slightly louder — a statement, not just a question  

**Bar 4:**  
- **Dm7** chord again  
- Play the **completion** of the motif:  
  - **D (on beat 1)**  
  - **F (on & of 1)**  
  - **A (on beat 2)**  
  - **C (on & of 2)** — **full note, held**  
- **Dynamic:** Softer than the previous bar, but with **weight** — a moment of closure, not resolution

### **Final Moment (Bar 4, & of 2):**  
- The **C** on the sax is held just long enough to let the piano and bass **answer** — a question that stays in the air.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- The room holds its breath.  
- You look up.  
- The story has been told, but not yet finished.

**That’s it.**  
Now, go make the next 3600 seconds mean something.
