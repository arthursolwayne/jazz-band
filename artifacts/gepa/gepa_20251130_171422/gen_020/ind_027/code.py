### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Rhythm:**  
- Kick on **1 & 3**  
- Snare on **2 & 4**  
- Hihat on **every eighth note**  
- Fill: A quick, syncopated ride cymbal hit on the **& of 3** to add tension  

**Mood:** Restless, anticipation. The sound of a memory waking up.

### **Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line in **F major**, chromatic approach to the **3rd** on beat 2  
- Notes: **F – G – Ab – Bb – C – D – Eb – F**  
- Chromatic run: **C – B – Bb – A** on beat 3, resolving to **G** on beat 4  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comping on **2 and 4** with 7th chords  
- Chords:  
  - **Beat 2:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
  - **Beat 4:** G7 (G, B, D, F)  
- Left hand: Walking bass line in **F major**, syncopated  
- Right hand: A descending line in **G minor** over F7, creating tension

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif 1:**  
  - **Beat 1:** F (long, open, with a slight breathy release)  
  - **Beat 2:** Ab (half note, high and aching)  
  - **Beat 3:** Bb (staccato, sharp, echoing the piano)  
  - **Beat 4:** Rest  
- **Phrasing:** Make the F feel like a question, the Ab like a memory, the Bb like a whisper of regret. Leave the last beat empty — let it hang.

### **Bar 3 – Full Band**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line continues, now with a chromatic approach to **F#** (leading to **G**)

- Right hand: A descending line from **C** to **Bb**, echoing the saxophone’s motif

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif 2:**  
  - **Beat 1:** G (half note, longing, with a slight vibrato)  
  - **Beat 2:** A (staccato, like a heartbeat)  
  - **Beat 3:** Bb (sustained, like a memory you can’t shake)  
  - **Beat 4:** Rest  
- **Phrasing:** This time, the G feels like a reply — a voice in the dark. The A is a pulse, the Bb is a moment you can't unhear.

  - **Beat 4:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
- Left hand: Walking line now in **D minor**  
- Right hand: A rising line from **Bb** to **F**, echoing the saxophone’s final note

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif 3 (Finale):**  
  - **Beat 1:** F (half note, strong, full, like a memory you can’t forget)  
  - **Beat 2:** Ab (staccato, echoing Diane’s chords)  
  - **Beat 3:** Bb (sustained, like a door closing)  
  - **Beat 4:** F (half note, resolving, but not quite closing the door)  

**Phrasing:** The final F is not an end — it’s a question, a memory, a moment that lingers.

**Final Note:**  
The last F is a whisper. Wayne Shorter leans forward. You don’t need to know why. You just know it matters.
