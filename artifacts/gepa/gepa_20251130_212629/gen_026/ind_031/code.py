---

**Bar 1 (0.00 – 1.50s):**  
*Little Ray on drums*  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3 (snare on 2 and 4).  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note.  
- At the end of the bar, a half-time fill:  
  - Hi-hat on beat 3 (half note), then a quick snare on the “&” of 4.  
  - *Silence on beat 4.*  
  - *The room holds its breath.*

---

**Bar 2 (1.50 – 3.00s):**  
*Marcus on bass*  
- Walking line in F minor, starting on B♭ (the 7th):  
  - B♭ – A – G – F (beat 1–4)  
  - Chromatic approach to F on beat 1:  
    - F♯ – F (chromatic descending)  
- No repetition. Every note is a new question.  

*Diane on piano*  
- Comping on 2 and 4, using 7th chords:  
  - **Beat 2:** E♭7 (E♭ – G – B♭ – D♭)  
  - **Beat 4:** A♭7 (A♭ – C – E♭ – G♭)  
- Subtle rubato on the offbeats, letting the tension build.

**Bar 3 (3.00 – 4.50s):**  
*Dante on tenor sax*  
- Your motif:  
  - **Beat 1:** F (long, open, resonant)  
  - **Beat 2:** A♭ (sharp, sudden, like a door creaking)  
  - **Beat 3:** D♭ (falling, a whisper)  
  - **Beat 4:** Silence.  
- Let the note hang. No resolution. Let the silence speak.  

*Marcus continues walking, Diane continues comping, Little Ray holds the groove.*

**Bar 4 (4.50 – 6.00s):**  
*Dante on tenor sax*  
- Return to the F from bar 3, but now with a twist:  
  - **Beat 1:** F (same as before, but this time, you play it with a little more weight)  
  - **Beat 2:** A♭ (same, but now you push it forward, a half-step ahead)  
  - **Beat 3:** C (a surprise — the 4th, not the D♭)  
  - **Beat 4:** Resolves to E♭ (the 3rd), but you hold it just a little too long —  
    *Let the note linger in the air, like a question you don’t answer.*

**End of 4 bars.**  
*The room is still. Wayne Shorter leans forward. He's listening.*
