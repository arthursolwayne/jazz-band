  "rationale": "The arrangement lacks jazz harmony with no 7th chords or extensions, only triads in the piano and bass. Rhythms are basic with minimal syncopation in the hihat. Melodies are simple and lack bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The interplay is weak with no call-and-response between horns and the trumpet remains silent throughout. The overall feel is generic and lacks the sophistication and spontaneity of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace triads in piano and bass with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) for authentic jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes and enclosures in sax and trumpet lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce more syncopation in hihat and add ghost notes on snare for a Latin jazz feel",
    "Implement walking bass lines with guide tones (roots, 3rds, 7ths) instead of static triads",
    "Add call-and-response between sax and trumpet, and include more dynamic contrast in the arrangement"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Mandate the use of 7th chords, chromatic approach notes, and swing feel in the rhythm section. Require call-and-response between horns and include examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
