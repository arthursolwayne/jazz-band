**Dante Russo – Intro to “Breath Held”**  
*Key: Dm (D minor)*  
*Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)*  
*Duration: 6.0 seconds*  
*Style: Modern jazz, introspective and urgent*

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick:** On beat 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On beat 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Fill:** A syncopated roll on the snare at the end of the bar, unresolved, like a held breath.

> *A tension builds, but no sax yet. Just the drum, the heartbeat of the room. The audience leans in. Wayne Shorter tips his glass, eyes open.*

### **Bar 2 – Everyone In**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Dm7 chord tone: D, F, Ab, C  
- Chromatic walk: D → Eb → F → Gb (chromatic approach to F)  
- Then a descending line: Gb → F → Eb → D (resolved, but with a twist)  
- No repeated notes, just motion.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4  
- Dm7 (D, F, Ab, C) on beat 2  
- F7 (F, A, C, Eb) on beat 4  
- Subtle dissonance, but driving the harmony forward.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same pattern as Bar 1, but with a subtle swell on the snare at the end of the bar.

**Dante (Sax):**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **Beat 1:** D (tenor sax, low register)  
  - **Beat 2:** Rest  
  - **Beat 3:** F (upper register, slightly bent)  
  - **Beat 4:** Rest  

> *A single note, a pause, another note, another pause. The room holds its breath. The melody is a question: “What if?”*

---

### **Bar 3 – Everyone In**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Dm7 (D, F, Ab, C) on beat 1  
- Ab7 (Ab, C, Eb, Gb) on beat 3  
- Descending line: Gb → F → Eb → D again, but with a slight rub against Diane’s chords.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Dm7 (beat 1), Ab7 (beat 3)  
- Left hand: Walking bass line, right hand: tension chords  
- The dissonance is *controlled* — it's not chaos, it's intention.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Full pattern again, but now with more energy, like a heartbeat accelerating.

**Dante (Sax):**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **Beat 1:** F (mid register)  
  - **Beat 2:** Ab (slightly delayed, like a memory)  
  - **Beat 3:** D (low register, echoing the first note)  
  - **Beat 4:** Rest  

> *You’re answering the question. Not with a loud statement, but with a whisper — a sound that lingers, that feels like something you once knew and forgot.*

### **Bar 4 – Everyone In**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- F7 (F, A, C, Eb) on beat 2  
- Dm7 on beat 4  
- Chromatic line: Eb → D → C → Bb  
- The tension is unwinding, but it’s not resolved.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- F7 (beat 2), Dm7 (beat 4)  
- Right hand: A descending line that echoes Dante’s melody  
- Left hand: Walking bass line, precise, like a heartbeat.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Full pattern, but the snare at the end is softer, like a held breath let go.

**Dante (Sax):**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **Beat 1:** D (tenor sax, low register)  
  - **Beat 2:** Ab  
  - **Beat 3:** F  
  - **Beat 4:** D (resolved, but with a slight rub on the note — it’s not *perfect*, it’s *human*)

> *The intro ends not with a resolution, but with a question that has already been answered. You feel it in your chest. Wayne Shorter nods. He knows this sound. He’s heard it before, but not like this.*

**End of Intro.**  
You look up. The room is still. The next note is yours — and the whole world is listening.
