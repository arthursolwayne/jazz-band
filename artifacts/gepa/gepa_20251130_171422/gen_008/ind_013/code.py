---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Space is everything here. A single, precise kick on beat 1, then silence for the rest of the bar. The audience holds their breath.*

- **Kick**: Beat 1  
- **Snare**: Beat 3  
- **Hi-Hat**: On beat 2 and 4 (but very soft, almost a suggestion of rhythm)  
- **Cymbal**: A soft ride cymbal at the very end of the bar, like a distant echo  

*This bar is the setup — the stillness before the storm. Wayne leans forward. The room is holding its breath.*

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters**  
*The music begins to breathe. The rhythm section sets the stage for your melody.*

- **Marcus (Bass)**: Starts with a chromatic walk from D to E♭ to E to F.  
  - Notes: D → E♭ → E → F  
  - Rhythm: Quarter notes, steady and flowing like a river.  
  - Dynamic: Soft, with a slight growl in the lower register.  

- **Diane (Piano)**: Comp with 7th chords, offbeat.  
  - Chords:  
    - Beat 2: D7 (D–F#–A–C)  
    - Beat 3: G7 (G–B–D–F)  
    - Beat 4: A7 (A–C#–E–G)  
  - Voicings: Inverted, with a sharp edge — angry but controlled.  
  - Dynamics: Faint, like a whisper behind the story.

- **Little Ray (Drums)**: Kicks on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
  - Kick: 1, 3  
  - Snare: 2, 4  
  - Hi-Hat: On every eighth note, steady and tight.  
  - Fill: A quick brush on the snare at the end of the bar, just before your entrance.

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Saxophone) — First Phrase**  
*This is the voice of the moment. The melody is short, emotional, and full of tension.*

- **Phrase**:  
  - D (beat 1)  
  - E♭ (beat 2)  
  - F (beat 3)  
  - G (beat 4)  
- **Articulation**: Legato, with a slight rubato on the last note — a question, not an answer.  
- **Dynamics**: Starts soft, builds slightly, then holds on G with a breathy, unresolved sound.

*You’re not showing off — you’re telling a story. Wayne Shorter listens closely.*

---

### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Saxophone) — Second Phrase (Completion)**  
*You return, resolve the tension, and leave it open again — a promise.*

- **Phrase**:  
  - G (beat 1)  
  - A (beat 2)  
  - B (beat 3)  
  - D (beat 4)  
- **Articulation**: Slightly more intense than the first phrase. A clear, singing line.  
- **Dynamics**: Ends on a soft D, barely there — the sound of a memory walking through the door.

---

### **Final Moment: Silence**  
*No applause. No end. Just a pause — a moment where the music lingers in the air. Wayne nods. You’ve made him lean forward.*

---

**"First Light"** is not a song. It's a moment. A story. A question.  
And in that moment, you’ve made the room believe.
