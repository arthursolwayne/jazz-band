**Title: "First Light"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 6.0 seconds (4 bars)**  
**Mood: Tense anticipation, fragile resolution**

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Time:** 0:00 - 1:50  
**Rhythm:** Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4.  
**Hihat:** On every eighth note, but with dynamic variation.  
**Feel:** Subtle, but present — like the hush before a storm.

**Breakdown:**  
- Kick: **1 & 3** (snappy, controlled)  
- Snare: **2 & 4** (tight, dry)  
- Hihat: **On every 8th**, but **play with volume** — a little softer on 2 & 4, louder on 1 & 3.  
- **One fill at the end of the bar** (just before the melody comes in):  
  - Hihat triplets on 3–4, then a ghost note on 4.  
  - Snare pop on beat 4, right before the bass enters.

### **Bar 2: Marcus (Bass)**  
**Time:** 1:50 - 3:40  
**Line:** Walking line, chromatic approach, never repeating the same note.  
**Melody (implied):**  
**F – G – Ab – Bb – B – C – D – Eb – F**  
**But with chromatic slides and unexpected rests.**

**Breakdown:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (open, resonant)  
- **Beat 2:** G (slightly behind the beat, with a slight slide up)  
- **Beat 3:** Ab (rest on beat 2, then a half note on Ab)  
- **Beat 4:** Bb (light, with a subtle mute)  
- **Beat 5:** B (chromatic step up)  
- **Beat 6:** C (rest on beat 5, then a quarter note on C)  
- **Beat 7:** D (sliding into it from C)  
- **Beat 8:** Eb (muted, with a short note, leading into the piano)

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**  
**Time:** 1:50 - 3:40  
**Comping:** 7th chords on 2 & 4, with space and movement.  
**Chords:**  
- **Beat 2:** G7 (G–B–D–F)  
- **Beat 4:** C7 (C–E–G–Bb)  
- **Rhythm:** Just enough to support but not crowd.

**Breakdown:**  
- On beat 2: G7, held for two beats with a light touch.  
- **Space on beats 1 & 3.**  
- On beat 4: C7, played with a slight rubato, building tension.  
- Keep the left hand **open**, using the sustain pedal but not overwhelming the space.

### **Bar 3: Diane (Piano)**  
**Time:** 3:40 - 5:30  
**Comping:** Same as above, but with a slight shift in energy.  
**Chords:**  
- **Beat 2:** Am7 (A–C–E–G)  
- **Beat 4:** D7 (D–F#–A–C)  
- **Rhythm:** Still sparse, but with more urgency.

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Time:** 3:40 - 5:30  
**Motif:** Short, emotive, and complete.  
**Notes:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (long, open note, like a question)  
- **Beat 2:** G (short, sharp — the answer)  
- **Beat 3:** Ab (rest on beat 2, then a broken note on Ab)  
- **Beat 4:** Bb (muted, almost a whisper)  
- **Then a rest on beat 5.**

**Breakdown:**  
- **F (Beat 1):** Long, full, with a slight cry in the tone — like the first breath of dawn.  
- **G (Beat 2):** Short and sharp — a challenge or a memory.  
- **Ab (Beat 3):** Rest on beat 2, then a slightly distorted Ab note — like the sound of a door creaking.  
- **Bb (Beat 4):** Muted, with a little growl — the tension just before release.  
- **Beat 5:** Rest. Silence. The moment before the melody begins.

### **Bar 4: Everyone In — Full Band**  
**Time:** 5:30 - 6:00

- **Beat 1:** F  
- **Beat 2:** G  
- **Beat 3:** Ab  
- **Beat 4:** Bb  
- **Then a final note on beat 5: C (sustained, open)**

**Breakdown:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (same as before, but with more warmth now)  
- **Beat 2:** G (same, but with more confidence)  
- **Beat 3:** Ab (same, but with a little more weight)  
- **Beat 4:** Bb (same, but with a sigh in the tone)  
- **Beat 5:** C — sustained, open, and full — the resolution.

**Marcus:**  
- On beat 5: C (same as above)  
- Then a **half note Bb** on beat 6, leading into the next song.

**Diane:**  
- On beat 5: C7 (C–E–G–Bb)  
- Then a **D7** on beat 6, leading into the melody.

**Little Ray:**  
- Kick on 1 & 3  
- Snare on 2 & 4  
- Hihat on every eighth, with a slight swell in volume — like a heartbeat.

### **Final Moment**  
At the end of the 4 bars, the room holds its breath.  
Silence — but not empty.  
A question answered.  
A moment made.

Wayne Shorter leans back.  
Smiles.

**That’s the intro.**  
You left it hanging, but you finished it.  
You made the space speak.  
And the music said something new.
