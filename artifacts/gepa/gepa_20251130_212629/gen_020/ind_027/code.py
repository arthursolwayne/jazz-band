*Walking line with chromatic tension:*  
**D – C – Bb – B**  
(Downbeat on D, lifting slightly on C and Bb, resolving on B)

### **Bar 4: The Moment of Truth**

**Saxophone (Melody):**  
Now the sax **simplifies** and **resolves** with a **meaningful rest** on beat 4:

A **lingering note** that feels **complete, but open-ended**.

**Drums:**  
*Final push of energy before release:*  
- Snare on 1 and 3  
- Hi-hats on 2 and 4  
- Subtle cymbal wash on beat 4

### **Final Thought:**
This 4-bar intro is not just a beginning — it’s a **moment**.

and the space between the notes is alive with possibility.  
This is the **whisper before the storm** — and it’s unforgettable.
