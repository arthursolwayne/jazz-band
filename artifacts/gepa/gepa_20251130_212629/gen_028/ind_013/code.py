**Intro: "Searching" (4 Bars – F Major – 160 BPM)**

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Kit: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
But here’s the twist: he plays the hihat **only on the "and" of 1 and 3** — leaving the *sounding* rhythm as:  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on **&1 and &3**.  
This gives a ghostly, off-kilter feel — like the beat is *almost* there, but not quite.  
A tension in the space between the notes.*

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp on 2 and 4, using 7th chords.*  
- **Beat 2:** F7 (F, A, C, E♭) – played with a slight *rubato* feel on the first note, like she’s leaning back.  
- **Beat 4:** B♭7 (B♭, D, F, A♭) – same treatment.  
She holds each chord on the downbeat, suspends the resolution, and leaves the tension hanging.

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice.*  
- **Beat 1:** F (root)  
- **Beat 2:** G♭ (chromatic approach to G)  
- **Beat 3:** G  
- **Beat 4:** A♭ (chromatic approach to A)  
He walks up, but with a subtle hesitation on the final note — like he’s holding back from the next chord.

**Bar 3 – Little Ray:**  
*Kicks back in with full rhythm, but now with a **fill on beat 3** — a ghostly cymbal swish that lingers.  
The tension is *about* to break, but it doesn’t.*

**Bar 3 – Diane:**  
*Same chords as before, but with a **half-step suspension** on beat 3 of each measure.*  
- **Beat 3:** F7 becomes F7♯9 on the *and* of 3, then resolves back to F7 on beat 4.  
She’s *tugging* the chord, not letting it go.

**Bar 3 – Marcus:**  
*Continuing the walking line, now slightly ascending.*  
- **Beat 1:** A  
- **Beat 2:** B♭ (chromatic approach to B)  
- **Beat 3:** B  
- **Beat 4:** C (chromatic approach to C♯)  
He’s climbing, but not yet reaching the peak.

**Bar 4 – Little Ray:**  
*Full rhythm again, but now with a **cymbal crash on the "and" of 3** — the sound of a door opening.  
The energy is rising.*

**Bar 4 – Diane:**  
*Now, she plays the **B♭7 chord** on beat 4, but with a *run* up the chord: B♭, D, F, A♭ — each note slightly detached, like she’s hesitant to commit.*  
The tension is *all* there. No resolution.

**Bar 4 – Marcus:**  
*Final walking note: C♯ — held for half a beat, then released into the silence.*  
He’s on the edge, but not over the line.

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Your moment.*  
- **Beat 1:** A (note) – played with a long, open tone, *leaning* into it.  
- **Beat 2:** Rest  
- **Beat 3:** F (note) – played softly, like a whisper  
- **Beat 4:** Rest  
You leave it **hanging** — a question in the air, not a statement.  
Silence speaks.  
Mystery lingers.  
And Wayne Shorter leans forward.

**Final Note (Bar 4):**  
You end the intro with a **rest** on beat 4 — not a note, not a resolution — just a pause.  
A question.  
A beginning.

That’s what he’s waiting for.
