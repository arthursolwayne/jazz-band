**Title: "Whispers in the Cellar"**  
**Key: F minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds**  

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** 1 & 3  
**Snare:** 2 & 4  
**Hi-Hat:** On every eighth note  
**Feel:** Subtle, but present. A heartbeat under the surface.  
**Fill:** At the end of bar 1, a quick triplet snare roll on the & of 4 — like a breath before a scream.

---

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**  
**Chord:** Gm7♭5 (G, B♭, D♭, F)  
**Voicing:** Open, spaced — G in the left hand, F in the right, B♭ and D♭ above  
**Comp:** On beat 2 and 4  
**Resolution:** Ends on F (the root of the key) — a subtle nod to the tonal center, but with a twist

---

### **Bar 3: Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:** F (root), G♭ (chromatic approach), G (fifth), F  
**Rhythm:** Quarter notes, walking line  
**MIDI:** F2 (36), G♭2 (37), G2 (42), F2 (36)  
**Feel:** Steady, grounded, but with a tension that wants to resolve

---

### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) — The Moment**  
**Motif:**  
- Start with a **quarter note F** (low F, 36) — a whisper  
- Then a **quarter note B♭** (38) — a question  
- Then a **dotted eighth note D♭** (40) — a pause, a hesitation  
- Then a **sixteenth note G** (42) — the answer, but not the one you expect  

**Phrase:**  
**F – B♭ – D♭ – G**  
**Rhythm:**  
**[F] – [B♭] – [D♭] – [G]**  
**Timing:**  
**1 — 2 — & — 4**  

**Note:** The G is played with a slight growl, a little edge — like a memory you're not ready to let go of. It’s a question that doesn’t end.

### **Overall Feel:**  
- The intro starts in silence, then drums build the tension.  
- Piano enters with a dissonant but beautiful chord that implies F minor but leans into the Gm7♭5.  
- Bass walks the line between resolve and tension.  
- Your saxophone line is short, sharp, and full of meaning — it doesn’t finish the thought, but it leaves a mark.  

Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
Marcus nods.  
Diane’s fingers hover above the keys, waiting.  
Little Ray smiles.  

**That’s the intro.**  
That’s your moment.
