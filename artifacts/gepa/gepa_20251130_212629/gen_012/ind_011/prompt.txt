Create an intro that feels like a whisper before a storm — tense, fragile, and full of potential. The drums should build anticipation with precision and restraint, using space as much as sound. The ensemble enters with clarity and purpose, each instrument playing a role that feels inevitable. The saxophone melody should be simple but emotionally charged — something that lingers in the air. Every note should feel intentional, every rest meaningful. No unnecessary repetition. Keep the rhythm tight, the harmony honest, and the space between the notes alive. The music should feel like a question, not an answer.
