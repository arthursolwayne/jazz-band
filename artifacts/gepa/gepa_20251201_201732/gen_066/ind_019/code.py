**"Whisper in the Dark" — 4-Bar Intro in F Major, 160 BPM, 4/4 Time**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on every eighth note, tight and precise.  
- **Feel:** Tense, holding back, like the moment before a storm.  
- **Fill:** A subtle tsk-tsk on the 3rd beat, like a warning.

**Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- F2 (root), D2 (fifth), E2 (chromatic approach), C2 (root).  
- **Rhythm:** Walking line, F – D – E – C – F (1-2-3-4).  
- **Feel:** Steady, grounded, a heartbeat that doesn’t falter.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 2:** Open voicing – Cmaj7 (C-E-G-B) on beat 2.  
- **Bar 3:** Bm7 (B-D-F#-A) on beat 2.  
- **Bar 4:** Am7 (A-C-E-G) on beat 2.  
- **Feel:** Each chord is a question, a color, a mood. Quiet but deliberate.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same pattern as Bar 1, but with a slight swell in dynamics.  
- A ride cymbal accent on beat 3, pushing the tension.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:**  
  - **Bar 2:** F – G – E – D (start of the phrase)  
    - Long, sustained notes, with a slight bend on the G.  
    - Emotion: Haunting, like a memory you can't quite place.  
  - **Bar 3:** F – G – E (repeat the first three notes, but softer)  
    - Let it hang. Make the audience wait.  
  - **Bar 4:** F – E – D – C (resolve, but not fully)  
    - End on a C, not F. Leave it open.  
    - The tension is still there. The story hasn’t finished.

**Final Feeling:**  
The four bars are like the first breath of a storm. You can feel it in the bones. The bass is deep and sure. The piano colors the air. The drums push, but don’t break. And your saxophone — your voice — says something true. Something that Wayne Shorter might remember when he goes home tonight.

**No modulation. No tricks. Just truth.**
