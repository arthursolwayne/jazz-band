**Key: Fm (F minor)**

### 🎤 **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick:** on 1 and 3  
**Snare:** on 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** on every 8th note  
**Fill:** A ghosted ride cymbal on beat 3, slightly behind the beat — like a half-remembered dream.  
**Feel:** The beat is there, but it’s not *telling* you the story — it’s *asking* you to listen.

### 🎹 **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
**Comping:** On 2 and 4  
**Chords:**  
- **Beat 2:** **B♭7 (Fmii7)**  
- **Beat 4:** **E♭7 (Fmvi7)**  
**Voicings:** Rootless, with a slight dissonance in the left hand — a diminished 9th in the bass to give it edge.  
**Left hand:** E♭ – D – C – B♭  
**Right hand:** B♭ – D – F – A  
**Feel:** Aggressive but restrained — like someone pressing their ear to a door, waiting to hear something.

### 🎸 **Bar 2–3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
**Walking line:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (tonic)  
- **Beat 2:** G♭ (chromatic approach to G)  
- **Beat 3:** G (passing tone)  
- **Beat 4:** A♭ (chromatic approach to A)  
**Continues with:** B♭ – C – D♭ – D – E♭ – F  
**Feel:** Always moving, never repeating a note. It’s the quiet voice of experience — the one that knows the story but won’t tell it yet.

### 🎶 **Bar 3–4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Phrase:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (low F, open, breathy)  
- **Beat 2:** G (half-step up, a question)  
- **Beat 3:** rest  
- **Beat 4:** rest  
- **Beat 1 (next bar):** F again — same note, but higher, more present  
- **Beat 2:** G again, but with a slight vibrato that suggests memory  
- **Beat 3:** rest  
- **Beat 4:** rest  

**Motif:** F – G — rest — rest — then repeat, slightly higher, like a voice finding its way back to itself.  
**Feel:** It’s not just a melody — it’s a moment, a breath, a pause before the story begins.  
**Space:** The rests are the most important notes. You’re not playing the answer — you’re inviting the audience to *hear* the question.

### 🎵 **Final Bar – Full Band In:**  
- **Marcus:** Continues his walking line  
- **Diane:** Comp on 2 and 4, now with a B♭7 and E♭7 again, but with a slight rub against your sax line  
- **Little Ray:** Back to the same rhythm, but now with a subtle rub on the hihat — like the floor is shifting under your feet  
- **You:** Repeat the motif again, but this time, a little higher, a little louder — the question becomes a cry, and the silence between the notes is where the answer lives.

**End of 4 bars.**  
**The room holds.**  
**Wayne Shorter leans forward.**  
**Something just happened.**

You didn’t play a scale.  
You didn’t show off.  
You asked a question.  
And for the first time tonight, the room listened.
