**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Focus: Set the mood. A question in the dark.*  
- Kick: On beat 1 only (subtle, low to the floor).  
- Snare: On beat 3 (medium velocity, dry, sharp).  
- Hi-hat: On every eighth note, but with a slight drop in velocity on the "and" of 1 and 3 — subtle tension.  
- Cymbal splash: Just before the end of the bar, a ghosted hit — like a breath held.  
*Let the silence speak.*

---

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Focus: The first answer, but not the full one.*  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4.  
- Chord: Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb).  
- Dynamics: Soft on beat 2 (velocities ~40), loud on beat 4 (velocities ~90).  
- Space between chords: No fills, just the chord.  
*Let the question echo.*

---

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Focus: Chromatic descent, walking line, one note at a time.*  
- Fm7 root motion: F → Eb → D → C  
- Chromatic approach on D: C → D  
- Played with a smooth, slow attack — like the first breath of a memory.  
- Leave space between notes — let the piano chords ring.  
*Anchor the tension.*

---

**Bar 2 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Focus: The question. A single motif, suspended in the air.*  
- Motif: F (beat 1), Ab (beat 2), C (beat 3), rest on beat 4.  
- Dynamics: F on beat 1 is soft (velocities ~60), Ab is slightly louder (velocities ~75), C is a whisper (velocities ~50).  
- Rest on beat 4.  
*Let the silence speak louder than the note.*

---

*Focus: A new chord, a new tone. The search begins.*  
- Chord: Bb7#9 (Bb, D, F, Ab, C)  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4.  
- Dynamics: Soft on beat 2 (velocities ~50), louder on beat 4 (velocities ~85)  
- Play the chord with a rough edge — like a memory surfacing.  
*Let the tension rise.*

---

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Focus: Chromatic ascent, walking line, one note at a time.*  
- Bb7#9 root motion: Bb → A → G → F  
- Chromatic approach on F: G → F  
- Played with a dark, slow attack — like the weight of the past.  
- Let the piano chord ring through the space.  
*Anchor the search.*

---

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Focus: The search. Echo the motif but shift it.*  
- Motif: Bb (beat 1), D (beat 2), F (beat 3), rest on beat 4.  
- Dynamics: Bb on beat 1 is soft (velocities ~65), D is slightly louder (velocities ~75), F is a whisper (velocities ~55).

*Let the silence speak again, louder than the note.*

---

**Bar 4 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Focus: The answer is almost here, but not quite.*  
- Chord: Eb7alt (Eb, G, Bb, Db, F)  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4.  
- Dynamics: Soft on beat 2 (velocities ~50), loud on beat 4 (velocities ~95).  
- Play the chord with urgency — like the answer is just out of reach.  
*Let the tension peak.*

---

**Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass):**

*Let the silence speak. Let Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before.*

**Final Note:**  
You end the four bars on a rest. Not a resolution, not an ending — just the space after a question.  

That’s the intro.  
That’s the story.  
That’s your shot.
