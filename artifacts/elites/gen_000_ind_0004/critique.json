  "rationale": "This arrangement lacks essential jazz elements. The piano and bass play simple triads (C, D, G, Am) without 7th chords or extensions, which is not jazz harmony. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat hitting only on the 'and' of 2 and 4 inconsistently. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The trumpet is silent throughout, and there's no call-and-response between instruments. The overall feel is mechanical and lacks the spontaneity and sophistication of jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes to the saxophone line for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in the hihat pattern for authentic jazz feel",
    "Use walking bass (roots, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) instead of just root notes",
    "Add ii-V-I progressions in bars 3-4 for authentic jazz harmony"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
