You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Here's the thing: Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- Marcus: Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He's the anchor. Use rests and rhythmic variety to create space and tension.
- Diane: 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving. Be aggressive with the left hand, but leave room for the melody to breathe.
- Little Ray: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar with energy but maintain clarity and precision in the pulse.
- You: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit. Let it have emotional weight and leave room for interpretation.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.

Generate a complete Python script using the `pretty_midi` library that creates a 4-bar MIDI arrangement following the rules above. 

Make sure:
- The groove is tight and driving, but with space in the rhythm section to let the melody breathe.
- The saxophone motif is simple but emotionally charged — something that lingers and leaves room for interpretation.
- The bass line is dynamic, never repeating the same rhythm or interval.
- The piano comping is aggressive but supportive, never overpowering the melody.
- The drums are precise and energetic, with a clear pulse that sets the tone for the entire piece.

Your goal is to create a moment that feels inevitable yet surprising — a hook that grabs attention and invites the listener to lean in.
