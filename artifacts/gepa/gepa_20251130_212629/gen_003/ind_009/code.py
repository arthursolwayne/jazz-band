**Intro: "Edge of the Door"**  
*Key: Fm | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4 | Duration: 6 seconds*

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*(Rests and space are as important as hits.)*

- **Kick**: On beat 1 only.  
- **Snare**: On beat 3 only.  
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth note (but with a soft, deliberate touch—like a heartbeat).  
- **Fill**: A ghost note on the "and" of 4, leading into the next bar.

**Effect**: A slow build. The room holds its breath. The tension is not in the sound, but in the *absence* of it. A quiet urgency.

---

### **Bar 2: Marcus (Bass)**  
*(Walking line, chromatic approach to Fm.)*

- **Notes**:  
  Beat 1: **F**  
  "and" of 1: **Gb** (chromatic approach)  
  Beat 2: **Bb**  
  "and" of 2: **A** (chromatic approach)  
  Beat 3: **Ab**  
  "and" of 3: **G** (chromatic approach)  
  Beat 4: **D**  
  "and" of 4: **Eb** (chromatic approach)

**Effect**: A forward motion, but with a sense of melancholy. The bass is not just walking—it's *searching*.

---

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**  
*(7th chords, comp on 2 and 4.)*

- **Beat 2**: **Fm7** (F, Ab, Bb, D)  
- **Beat 4**: **G7** (G, B, D, F)  
- **Voicings**: Rootless, open, with a slight dissonance on the G7 to hint at a possible modulation or key shift (but never resolve).

**Effect**: She’s not just playing chords—she’s setting up a *question*. A tension that doesn’t want to be answered.

---

### **Bar 3: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*(Same pattern as Bar 1, matching the rhythm to build momentum.)*

- **Kick**: 1 only  
- **Snare**: 3 only  
- **Hi-hat**: Every eighth note  
- **Fill**: Ghost note on the "and" of 4, again—just a whisper.

**Effect**: The heartbeat is steady, but it’s *impatient*. The room feels like it’s closing in.

---

### **Bar 3: Marcus (Bass)**  
*(Continuation of the walking line from Bar 2.)*

- **Notes**:  
  Beat 1: **Eb**  
  "and" of 1: **D** (chromatic approach)  
  Beat 2: **C**  
  "and" of 2: **B** (chromatic approach)  
  Beat 3: **Bb**  
  "and" of 3: **A** (chromatic approach)  
  Beat 4: **F**  
  "and" of 4: **Gb** (chromatic approach)

**Effect**: The bass is now *left of center*, like it’s trying to find a home it doesn’t remember.

---

### **Bar 4: Diane (Piano)**  
*(Same as Bar 2, but with a slight variation on the G7 to build tension.)*

- **Beat 2**: **Fm7**  
- **Beat 4**: **G7#9** (G, B, D, F, A#)  
- **Voicing**: The #9 adds a dissonance that hints at something unresolved, almost like a warning.

**Effect**: The piano is the first to *challenge* the listener. It’s not just music—it’s a question.

---

### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax)**  
*(Your moment. The motif.)*

- **Notes**:  
  Beat 1: **Ab** (high, open, tension)  
  "and" of 1: **rest**  
  Beat 2: **Bb** (low, grounded, but unresolved)  
  "and" of 2: **rest**  
  Beat 3: **Ab** (same as Beat 1, but lower)  
  "and" of 3: **rest**  
  Beat 4: **rest**  
  "and" of 4: **rest**

**Effect**: A single voice, echoing like a memory, leaving the room hanging. Not a resolution, but a *promise*—something just out of reach.

---

### Final Effect

Silence hangs at the end of the fourth bar. The room is not empty, but it *feels* empty. Like a door almost opened, but not quite. The four bars are not a beginning—they are a **threshold**.

Wayne Shorter leans forward.

He’s heard something he hasn’t heard before.
