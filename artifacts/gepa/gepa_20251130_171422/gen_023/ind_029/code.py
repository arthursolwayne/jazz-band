**Title: "First Breath"**  
*Key: Fm | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4 | Duration: 6 seconds*  

---

**Bar 1 (0:00–1:50)**  
**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on **1 and 3**  
- Snare on **2 and 4**  
- Hi-hat on **every eighth note** (but vary dynamics slightly: soft on 1, louder on 3)  
- Add a subtle cymbal swish on the “&” of 3 to create a sense of anticipation  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line, chromatic approach to Fm  
- **F – Eb – D – C** (on 1, 2, 3, 4)  
- Then **Bb – B – Ab – G** (on 1, 2, 3, 4 of next bar, but not yet)  
- **C** on the “&” of 4 to lead into Bar 2  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on **2 and 4**  
- **Fm7 (F, Ab, Bb, D)** on beat 2  
- **Fm7 with a Bb in the upper register** on beat 4  
- Keep it sparse but rich — let the tension build  

**Dante (Sax):**  
- **Silence**  
- Wait. Let the rhythm section speak first. Make them *want* to hear you.  

---

**Bar 2 (1:50–3:40)**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Bb – B – Ab – G** (on 1, 2, 3, 4)  
- Chromatic approach to G, then resolving into Fm  
- **Ab** on the “&” of 4 to create a rub against the piano  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on beat 2: **Fm7**  
- Comp on beat 4: **Fm7 with a C in the upper register**  
- Add a **Bb** on the “&” of 3, just under the sax line  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth, but slightly *pushed* on the “&” of 3 to create a subtle rub  
- Keep the energy tight but fluid  

**Dante (Sax):**  
- **Motif:**  
  - **F – G – Eb – D** (ascending, then descending)  
  - Play it with a lean, a little *laid back*, but with urgency in the air  
  - End on **D** (a suspended note) — let it hover, unresolved  

---

**Bar 3 (3:40–5:30)**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **C – Bb – B – Ab**  
- Chromatic line up to the **C** again, but with tension  
- **Ab** on the “&” of 4 again, leading into Bar 4  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on beat 2: **Fm7 with a Bb in the melody line**  
- Comp on beat 4: **Fm7 with a C in the upper register**  
- Add a **Db** on the “&” of 3, creating a *microtonal* tension  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth, but now with a slight *pull* on the “&” of 2 — a subtle shift in time  
- Keep the groove tight but alive  

**Dante (Sax):**  
- **Motif again:**  
  - **F – G – Eb – D**  
  - But now with more space between notes — *space is the sound*  
  - End again on **D**, but this time with a *hint* of the **C** underneath it  
  - Let the band fill the space you left  

---

**Bar 4 (5:30–6:00)**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **F – Eb – D – C** (back to the start, but now with a different weight)  
- **C** on the “&” of 4 — still unresolved, still *waiting*  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on beat 2: **Fm7**  
- Comp on beat 4: **Fm7 with a C in the upper register**  
- Add a **Bb** on the “&” of 3 again — now it’s a *call and response* with the sax  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth, but now with a *slight* delay on the “&” of 4  
- Let the groove breathe here — a question in the air  

**Dante (Sax):**  
- **Finish the motif:**  
  - **F – G – Eb – D** (again, but now with a little **C** in the upper register)  
  - End on **C**, resolving the tension, but not fully — it’s a *hint* of where it *could* go  
  - Let the silence after that last note be your answer

**Final Note:**  
That last **C** — it’s not the end. It’s the beginning. And if Wayne Shorter leans forward, it’s because he knows this is the start of something *new*. Something that could go anywhere.
