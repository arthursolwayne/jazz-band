### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Fill:** A subtle, syncopated brush stroke on the "and" of 3, just before the bass enters  
**Mood:** Suspense. The room holds its breath. You can feel the weight of the silence.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line**  
**Notes (F Major scale with chromatic approaches):**  
**Beat 1:** G♯ (chromatic passing tone)  
**Beat 2:** A  
**Beat 3:** B♭ (chromatic descending)  
**Beat 4:** C  
**Repeat the same pattern for the rest of the bar (4 beats)**

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano) – Comping on 2 and 4**  
**2nd beat of the bar:**  
- **Left hand:** Root (F)  
- **Right hand:** F7 (F, A, C, E♭)  
**4th beat of the bar:**  
- **Left hand:** Root (F)  
- **Right hand:** F7 (F, A, C, E♭)

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax) – Your Moment**  
**Phrase:**  
**Beat 1:** F  
**Beat 2:** G  
**Beat 3:** A  
**Beat 4:** D  
**Hold the D for a half-beat (1/8 note) on the "and" of 4 – let it hang in the air.**  
**Mood:** This is the question. This is the opening line of the story. It’s not a run, not a show, but a voice that says, *“I’ve been waiting for this.”* You leave it open, but it’s clear. It’s *you*, and it’s *now*.

**Final Note (on "and" of 4):**  
You hold the D, and the room holds it with you. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The story begins.

**End of Bar 4 – 6 seconds.**  
**The intro is set. The story begins.**
