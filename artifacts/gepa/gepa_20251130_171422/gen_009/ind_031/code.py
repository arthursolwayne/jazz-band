**Dante Russo – Intro to “Where the Shadows Meet”**  
*4 bars in Dm, 160 BPM, 4/4 time. For Wayne Shorter, in Montclair, at 2am.*

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Space is the instrument here. The crowd is still. The room holds its breath.*

- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note, but not too loud — just a whisper of motion  
- **Cymbal:** A soft ride cymbal on beat 3, fading into the air  

**Effect:** A heartbeat. A question. The room is waiting.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
- **Notes:** Dm7 → F → Eb → D  
- **Rhythm:** Walking chromatic line, starting on beat 3  
- **Feel:** Dark, slow, like a memory surfacing  

**Line:**  
**Beat 3:** F  
**Beat 4:** Eb  
**Beat 1:** D  
**Beat 2:** C#  
**Beat 3:** D  
**Beat 4:** Dm7 (D, F, Ab, C) – played as a single note: D (the root)  

**Effect:** The anchor, the pulse beneath the story.

---

#### **Diane (Piano)**  
- **Chords:** Dm7 on beat 1, F7 on beat 2, Eb7 on beat 3, Dm7 on beat 4  
- **Rhythm:** Comp on the offbeats — 2 and 4 — with a dissonant, angry edge  
- **Notes:**  
  - Beat 1: Dm7 (D, F, Ab, C)  
  - Beat 2: F7 (F, A, C, E♭)  
  - Beat 3: Eb7 (Eb, G, Bb, D)  
  - Beat 4: Dm7 (D, F, Ab, C)  
- **Left Hand:** Walking bass line, but chromatic and tense — F → E → D → C# → D  
- **Right Hand:** Voice-leading, not block chords — a thread of tension and release  

**Effect:** The anger is in the spaces. She’s not yelling — she’s *screaming* inside the harmony.

---

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
- **Phrase:** One short, emotional motif, starting on beat 1, ending on beat 3, and leaving the final note open  
- **Notes:**  
  - Beat 1: D (low D)  
  - Beat 2: Eb (with a slight rub on the beat)  
  - Beat 3: F (sustained and held, like a memory)  
  - Beat 4: Rest  

**Effect:** A question. A memory. A moment that lingers. It’s not a scale run — it’s a *soul* run. It’s the kind of line that makes a man in the back of the room lean forward and think, *“I’ve heard that before, but I’ve never heard it like that.”*

---

### **Bar 4 – Resolution (With Uncertainty)**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
- **Notes:** D → C# → D → Eb  
- **Rhythm:** Syncopated, walking under the tension  
- **Feel:** Pushing the melody forward, not repeating the same note

#### **Diane (Piano)**  
- **Chord:** Dm7 on beat 1  
- **Beat 2:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
- **Beat 3:** Eb7 (Eb, G, Bb, D)  
- **Beat 4:** Dm7 again, but now with a slight delay — like the end of a sentence that isn’t finished  
- **Left Hand:** Chromatic run again, but this time ending on C# instead of D — a question mark instead of a period

#### **Little Ray (Drums)**  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** Still on every eighth, but now with a tiny bit more push  
- **Cymbal:** A soft ride on beat 3, slightly more pronounced than before — like the moment before the storm

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
- **Phrase:** Echo of the first line, but now on the second half of the bar  
- **Notes:**  
  - Beat 3: F (same as before)  
  - Beat 4: Rest  
- **Effect:** A return, not a resolution. A beginning, not an end.

**Final Bar: Silence, but not empty.**  
The room holds the sound of what could have been. A story, a memory, a question.  
Wayne Shorter nods.  
He’s heard it.  
He *feels* it.  
And he’s smiling.
