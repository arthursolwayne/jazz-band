You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Here's the thing: Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Use space and rhythm to build tension. Let the silence speak. The energy should feel like it's waiting for something — not just filling the space, but holding it.

Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before. Keep it concise, emotional, and memorable. It should feel like a moment — not a run, not a showcase, but a feeling that lingers.

Composition Rules:
- Marcus: Walk with chromatic motion, keep it moving, never repeat the same note. Be the anchor but let the melody breathe.
- Diane: Use 7th chords, comp on the offbeats, support the rhythm and the melody. Be angry, but never in the way that drowns out the story.
- Little Ray: Play with precision — kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar with energy but leave room for the melody to breathe.
- You: This is your moment. One short, expressive motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit.

Make the intro feel like a beginning, not just a setup. Let it tell a story in its brevity. Use rests. Use contrast. Let silence be as important as sound. Make it memorable. Make it feel like the start of something real.
