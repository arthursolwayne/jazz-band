### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**
**Pattern:**  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (closed)  
- **Fill:** A subtle, open hi-hat on beat 4, just before the band comes in, like a breath before the first note.  

**Feel:** Tense, waiting. The room holds its breath.

#### **Diane (Piano) – Comping (D minor 7th chords)**  
**Chords:**  
- **Bar 2:** Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
- **Bar 3:** Gm7 (G, B♭, D, F)  
- **Bar 4:** Cm7 (C, E♭, G, B♭)  

**Rhythm:**  
- Comp on beats 2 and 4 (with a subtle left-hand walking bass line, just below the surface).  
- Right hand plays the 7th chord on beat 2, slightly altered (e.g., Dm7♭5 on beat 2 of bar 2).  
- No melody, just color and space.

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax) – Melody (Motif)**  
**Notes (written in D minor):**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - D (beat 1)  
  - F (beat 2)  
  - G♭ (beat 3)  
  - A (beat 4)  
- **Bar 3:**  
  - C (beat 1)  
  - D♭ (beat 2)  
  - D (beat 3)  
  - F (beat 4)  
- **Bar 4:**  
  - G♭ (beat 1)  
  - A (beat 2)  
  - C (beat 3)  
  - [Rest] (beat 4)  

**Phrasing:**  
- Play the first four notes of the motif clearly, with a slight rubato on the final note of bar 2 (A).  
- Bar 3 mirrors the movement of bar 2 but in a new register.  
- Bar 4 ends on a rest — a pause, a question.  

**Stylistic Notes:**  
- No scale runs.  
- No vibrato on the first statement.  
- The last note of bar 4 is *not* resolved — it’s left hanging.

### **Final Moment:**  
The room is silent for a beat. Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
The rhythm section holds.  
You hold.  
And in that space, something new begins.  

**That’s the intro.**
