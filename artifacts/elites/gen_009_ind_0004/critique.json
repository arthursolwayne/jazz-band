  "rationale": "The arrangement lacks essential jazz harmony elements, relying on basic triads in the piano and bass without 7th chords or extensions. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with the hihat hitting only occasionally on upbeats, and the snare lacks ghost notes or syncopated accents. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The trumpet is completely silent, and there's little interplay between the horns. The overall feel is academic and lacks the spontaneity and groove of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz sophistication",
    "Add chromatic approach notes and enclosures to the saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in the hihat pattern and add ghost notes on the snare for authentic Latin jazz feel",
    "Use walking bass lines with roots, 3rds, 5ths, and 7ths instead of just root notes",
    "Add call-and-response between the saxophone and trumpet for better interplay and conversation"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize the need for 7th chords in the piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in the rhythm section, and mandate call-and-response between horns. Provide examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns to guide the composer."
