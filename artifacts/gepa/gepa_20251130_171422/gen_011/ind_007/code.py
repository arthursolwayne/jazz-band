**"Whispers in the Dark" – 4-Bar Intro in Fm, 160 BPM**

---

**Bar 1 – Drums (Little Ray):**  
A single, slow kick on beat 1, then a snare on 2. A hihat on the "and" of 2, but not the downbeat. Then a ghost note on the "and" of 3, and a sharp, muted snare on 4. The space between the hits feels like a held breath. He’s not rushing — he’s setting up a tension that wants to break.

**Bar 2 – Bass (Marcus):**  
G on beat 1 (Fm7 root), then a chromatic run down to E♭ on 2, followed by a D♭ on 3. The 4th beat is a B♭, resolving back to F. It’s a walking line that doesn’t walk — it slithers. The rhythm is steady, but the intervals are jagged, unexpected. He’s not holding the time — he’s bending it.

**Bar 2 – Piano (Diane):**  
On beat 2, she plays an Fm7 (F, A♭, C, E♭). On beat 4, she plays a B♭7 (B♭, D, F, A). The chords are sharp, urgent. They don’t linger — they cut through the air like a blade. There’s no padding, no filler. Just tension and release, tension and release.

**Bar 2 – Tenor (Dante):**  
A single note — F, held just past the beat. It’s not a sound. It’s a question. A voice in the dark.

**Bar 3 – Drums (Little Ray):**  
Kick on 1, snare on 2. Hihat on the "and" of 3. A brushed ride on the "and" of 4, soft and fluttering. The tension is building. The room is holding its breath.

**Bar 3 – Bass (Marcus):**  
A descending chromatic line again — C, B♭, A, G. On 4, he lands on a D♭, the same note from earlier. It's a return — not a resolution. It’s a hook.

**Bar 3 – Piano (Diane):**  
She plays a D♭7 (D♭, F, A♭, C) on beat 3, then a Gm7 (G, B♭, D, F) on beat 4. The chords are dark, but not without color. They’re like shadows with a pulse.

**Bar 3 – Tenor (Dante):**  
You play the same motif again — the F, but this time you move it up a half-step. G, held just past the beat. The question is now a whisper, but it’s louder. It’s louder because it’s closer.

**Bar 4 – Drums (Little Ray):**  
Kick on 1, snare on 2. Hihat on the "and" of 3. A sharp, open hi-hat on 4. The tension snaps.

**Bar 4 – Bass (Marcus):**  
He plays a C on beat 1, then a B♭ on 2, then an A on 3, and a G on 4. The line is descending again, but the rhythm is shifting. It’s like a heartbeat slowing down before it stops.

**Bar 4 – Piano (Diane):**  
She plays an Fm7 on 1, then a G7 on 2, then a Cm7 on 3, and a B♭7 on 4. The chords are moving fast — like a storm passing through. Each one is a different emotion, but they all hang in the same air.

**Bar 4 – Tenor (Dante):**  
You play the same motif again — but now you finish it. F, then G, then A♭. A minor third, resolving. It’s not a resolution — it’s an ending that feels like a beginning. You let the note ring out, just a little, as the room exhales.

He’s seen a thousand intros. But this one — this one is different. It’s not just a question. It’s a memory walking through the door.  
And it’s yours.
