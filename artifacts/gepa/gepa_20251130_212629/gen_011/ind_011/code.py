**Intro: "Whispers in the Cellar"**  
*Key: Dm (D minor)*  
*Tempo: 160 BPM | 4/4 time*  
*Duration: 6.0 seconds (4 bars)*  
*Emotion: Mystery, tension, anticipation*

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick on 1 and 3**  
- **Snare on 2 and 4**  
- **Hi-hat on every eighth note** – *but play it *soft*, barely there, like the sound of a rainstorm just outside the window.*  
- **Fill at the end of the bar:** A **ghosted, syncopated snare** on the "and" of 3. *It lingers, like a question left unanswered.*

---

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4:**  
  - **2:** Dm7 (D F A C) – *played with a slight rubato on the D, like a sigh.*  
  - **4:** Gm7 (G Bb D F) – *sharp and angular, a collision of memory and tension.*  
- **Space is everything.** Let the silence between chords breathe. *She's not playing to fill the room — she's playing to make it empty.*

---

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Walking line**, but with **chromatic tension** before resolving:  
  - **D – C – B – A – G – F – E – D** (chromatic descending line starting on the "and" of 1)  
  - **Resolves on the "and" of 3** with a **G**, then walks up to **A** on beat 4.  
- **Dynamic shift:** *Start soft, grow louder on the chromatic run, then drop back on the resolve.*  
- *He’s not just playing the line — he’s painting the space around it.*

---

**Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:** A simple, haunting phrase — don’t play it all. *Leave it hanging.*

  **Phrase:**  
  - **Beat 1:** D (long, low, breathy — like a whisper)  
  - **Beat 2:** F (sharp, quick — like a flicker of light)  
  - **Beat 3:** A (sustained, aching — like a memory)  
  - **Beat 4:** Rest (long, *very* long — silence speaks louder than notes)  

- **Dynamics:** *Start with a soft, breathy D, crescendo into the F, hold the A with emotional weight, then let it fall away into silence.*  
- *You don’t finish the phrase. You leave it open. You let Wayne Shorter feel it.*

**Final Image:**  
Wayne Shorter leans forward, his whiskey untouched. The room holds its breath.  
The intro is done.  
But the music has already begun.
