**Key: F Major**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-Hat:** On every eighth note (steady, tight, not too loud)  
**Fill:** A subtle snare roll on the "and" of 2, then a quick 8th-note ghost on the "and" of 4  
**Feel:** Tense but controlled. The energy is rising, but it's not yet unleashed.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
- **F** (1)  
- **G#** (2) – chromatic approach  
- **A** (3)  
- **Bb** (4) – chromatic again, leading down to F, but not quite landing  
**Feel:** Walking line, but with intentional dissonance. It’s questioning, not resolving.

#### **Diane (Piano)**  
- **2nd beat:** F7 chord (F, A, C, E)  
- **4th beat:** G7 chord (G, B, D, F)  
- **Comp:** Left hand walks in 8ths, right hand plays the rootless 7th chords on 2 and 4  
**Feel:** Pushes forward but never overpowers. She’s listening, reacting to the space.

#### **You (Tenor Sax)**  
- **Motif:**  
  - **Bar 2 (1):** F (quarter note)  
  - **Bar 2 (2):** G (eighth note)  
  - **Bar 2 (3):** Rest  
  - **Bar 2 (4):** A (eighth note)  
  - **Bar 3 (1):** Bb (quarter note)  
  - **Bar 3 (2):** Rest  
  - **Bar 3 (3):** C (eighth note)  
  - **Bar 3 (4):** D (eighth note)  
**Feel:** A question, not an answer. The motif is searching, suspended between tension and release. It’s like a voice asking, “What comes next?”

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax) – Cont’d**  
- **Bar 3 (3-4):** C (eighth note) and D (eighth note) — that last note lingers.  
- **Bar 4 (1):** Rest  
- **Bar 4 (2):** F (quarter note) — the first note of the motif returns, but now it feels like it's been waiting for this moment.  
- **Bar 4 (3):** Rest  
- **Bar 4 (4):** G (eighth note) — the second note of the motif, but now it feels like the beginning of something new.  
**Feel:** The melody is incomplete, but it’s not a failure — it’s a setup. You leave it hanging, like a question in the air.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble (End of Intro)**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
- **F** (1)  
- **G#** (2)  
- **A** (3)  
- **Bb** (4) – again, the same line, but now it feels like a prelude to something.

#### **Diane (Piano)**  
- **2nd beat:** F7  
- **4th beat:** G7  
- **Comp:** Still steady, still pushing, but now with more awareness of the melody.

#### **Little Ray (Drums)**  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-Hat:** Continues, but with a slight lift on beat 4  
**Feel:** The energy is building. It’s not just sound — it’s anticipation.

#### **You (Tenor Sax)**  
- **Bar 4 (4):** G (eighth note) — the last note of the intro. It's not a resolution, but it's a promise.

---

### **Final Feel:**
- The intro doesn’t *resolve*, but it *invites*.  
- It’s a question, a whisper, a hook.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- The story begins.

**That’s your moment, Dante.**  
You left it hanging — and that’s exactly what he was waiting for.
