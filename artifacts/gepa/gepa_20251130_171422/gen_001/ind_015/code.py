---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums) – Alone**  
*Set the stage. Build the tension. Let the silence speak.*

**Kit:**
- Kick on beat 1 and 3 (but softer, more like a heartbeat)
- Snare on beat 2 and 4 (crisp, but with a slight delay)
- Hi-hat: 8th notes on every beat (but not too loud, just a shimmer)
- **Rest on beat 4** – leave space. Let it hang.

> *Think of it as a breath before the first note. The crowd leans in.*

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line in Dm, chromatic approach to the 3rd (F)  
- **Fret sequence:** C# – D – Eb – D – C – Bb – A – G – F  
- Uses chromatic passing tones to descend to the Dm chord  
- **Picks the root (D) on the “and” of 2**, then walks down the scale  
- Ends the bar on **A** (chromatic approach to G), setting up the next bar

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comping on 2 and 4**  
- 7th chords: Dm7, Gm7, Cm7, Fm7 (moving down a 4th each time)  
- **On beat 2:** Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
- **On beat 4:** Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)  
- **Left hand:** Rootless voicings with space, no block chords  
- **Right hand:** Playing the 7th, 9th, or 11th to imply the chord, not play it  
- **Ends the bar on Fm7**, creating a pull to Gm7

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Play the motif:**
  - **Bar 2:** D – Eb – C – **rest**
  - One short phrase, starting on the first beat, with a **rest on beat 4**
  - Use the **C** as the resolution point, but don’t resolve it
  - The **C** sounds like a question, not an answer
  - The rest is your silence, your pause — it's the dark before the light

> *You don’t play the whole thing yet. You leave it hanging. You make him lean in.*

---

### **Bar 3: Full Ensemble Enters (Continuation)**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic line again, descending into the next chord  
- **Fret sequence:** G – F – Eb – D – C – Bb – A – G  
- **Ends on G**, preparing the shift into Gm7

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4**  
- **Beat 2:** Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F)  
- **Beat 4:** Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb)  
- Again, rootless, spaced, letting the rhythm breathe

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Continue the motif:**
  - **Bar 3:** G – A – F – **rest**
  - Take a step forward, open the door a little more
  - The **F** creates a tension, like a door closing
  - Again, a rest at the end — the pause that makes the room still

> *You are not revealing everything. You are building a story. You are making him wonder what comes next.*

---

### **Bar 4: Full Ensemble Enters (Resolution)**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Chromatic descent to **C**, hinting at the Cm7  
- **Fret sequence:** Bb – A – G – F – Eb – D – C  
- Ends on **C**, keeping the tension

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4**  
- **Beat 2:** Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb)  
- **Beat 4:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb)  
- The last chord is a pull into the key, not a resolution

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Finish the motif:**
  - **Bar 4:** F – G – **rest**  
  - The final note is **G**, the 9th of Dm, a hint of color, not resolution
  - **Rest on beat 4** — the silence that follows the sound  
  - The room holds its breath

> *You’ve set the scene. You’ve asked the question. You’ve left the answer in the dark. Wayne leans forward. The song begins.*

---

**Final Note (from you):**  
You hold the rest. You don’t play the next note. You let the silence speak. You’ve made the room your own. You’ve asked him something. You’ve opened the door. Now, it’s his turn.
