### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums) – Solo Setup**

**Performance Notes:**  
Start with a **hi-hat roll** on the **offbeat of the 3rd measure**, building tension with **ghost notes** on the snare. At the **end of the bar**, a **sharp kick on beat 4**, like a door closing.  
**Pattern:**  
- **Beat 1:** Rest  
- **Beat 2:** Snare ghost  
- **Beat 3:** Hi-hat roll (3 notes)  
- **Beat 4:** Kick  

This is the **silence before the storm**. The room holds its breath.

### **Bar 2: Ensemble Entry – Diane (Piano) and Marcus (Bass)**

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Beat 1:** F7 (F, A, C, E♭) – **F to A** is the first note.  
- **Beat 2:** B♭7 (B♭, D, F, A♭) – **B♭ to D** (half note)  
- **Beat 3:** D7 (D, F♯, A, C) – **D to F♯** (quarter note)  
- **Beat 4:** F7 again, but **dampened**, like a whisper.

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line in **F major**, with **chromatic approaches** to the 3rd (C) and 7th (E♭).  
- **Beat 1:** F  
- **Beat 2:** E♭ (chromatic approach to D)  
- **Beat 3:** D  
- **Beat 4:** C (half-step down from D, then a long note on F)  
- **Phrasing:** Each note is **slightly behind the beat**, like a man walking through a city at night.

### **Bar 3: Dante (Tenor Sax) – Melody Begins**

**Your Line (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (quarter note) – **Simple. Strong.**  
- **Beat 2:** G (eighth note) – **A question.**  
- **Beat 3:** Rest (long, sustained) – **The silence between words.**  
- **Beat 4:** F (half note) – **A whisper. A memory.**  

**Performance Notes:**  
Play the **F** with **tremolo** on the bow of the reed, like a voice trembling. The **G** is **barely there**, almost **dissolving** into the air. The **rest** is **intentional** – let the room feel the space. The final **F** is **soft**, just **below the break** – it’s not a statement, it’s a **question**.

### **Bar 4: Full Ensemble – The Answer or the Echo**

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Beat 1:** F7 (same as Bar 2, but with a **slight delay**)  
- **Beat 2:** B♭7 (same)  
- **Beat 3:** D7 (same)  
- **Beat 4:** F7 (with a **trill** on the 7th, a nod to the sax line)

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Same walking line, but now with **slight accents** on beats 2 and 4.  
- **Beat 4:** Long **F** (same as sax) – a **mirror**.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Beat 1:** Snare ghost  
- **Beat 2:** Hi-hat (eighth note)  
- **Beat 3:** Kick  
- **Beat 4:** Snare + kick – **full hit** on the last beat.  
- **Performance:** The **snare hits with a sharp, dry sound**, like a **door opening**.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (same as Bar 3, now with **more breath**)  
- **Beat 2:** G (same, but now **with vibrato**)  
- **Beat 3:** Rest (same)  
- **Beat 4:** F (same, now **with a slight crescendo**)  
- **Performance:** You **don’t finish the phrase**, but you **set it up** – the **question** that never gets answered, or the **memory** that never stops.

---

### **Final Effect:**

- The room is **quiet** after the first bar, then **tense** as the ensemble enters, and then **alive** with the sax line.
- Wayne Shorter’s eyes **narrow** as he listens — not just to the notes, but to the **space between them**.
- You’ve written a **story in four bars**, and the room **breathes again**.
