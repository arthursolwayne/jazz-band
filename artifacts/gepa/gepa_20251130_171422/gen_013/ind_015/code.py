**Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5 seconds):**  
**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on beat 1 (F) and 3 (F).  
- Snare on 2 (Bb) and 4 (F).  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note: F - Bb - F - Bb - F - Bb - F - Bb.  
- Slight rim shot on beat 2.  
- **Feel:** A breath held. No cymbal, just the heartbeat of the room. A waiting. A question in the dark.

**Bar 2 (1.5 - 3.0 seconds):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line in F major, chromatic approach to G (Dorian sound).  
- Notes: F - G - Bb - A - G - F - E - D - C - Bb - A - G  
- **Feel:** The roots are moving, but not in a predictable way. It’s the undercurrent of a memory.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comping on 2 and 4 with 7th chords.  
- Chords:  
  - Beat 2: G7 (G - B - D - F)  
  - Beat 4: A7 (A - C - E - G)  
- **Feel:** Tension building. She’s not backing you — she’s pushing.

**Bar 3 (3.0 - 4.5 seconds):**  
**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif starts on beat 1:**  
  - F - G - Bb - A  
  - Let it hang on the A.  
- **Space is everything.**  
- **Feel:** The melody is urgent, but not rushed. It's the sound of a door opening, but no one going through.

**Bar 4 (4.5 - 6.0 seconds):**  
**Everyone in:**  
- **Marcus:** Chromatic line up to C (F - G - A - Bb - B - C), resolving to E.

  - Beat 1: E7 (E - G - B - D)  
  - Beat 2: D7 (D - F - A - C)  
  - Beat 3: C7 (C - E - G - B)  
  - Beat 4: B7 (B - D - F# - A)  
- **Little Ray:**  
  - Kick on 1 and 3 (F and F again).  
  - Snare on 2 and 4 (Bb and F).  
  - Hi-hat on every eighth, but with a fill on beat 3.  
- **You (Tenor Sax):**  
  - **Finish the motif:**  
    - F - G - Bb - A  
    - Then: C - Bb - A - G  
    - **End on G, sustained.**  
  - **Feel:** The story is told — not finished, but something new has been born.

**Final Note (G):**  
Held in the air. A question. A promise.  
The room holds.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.
