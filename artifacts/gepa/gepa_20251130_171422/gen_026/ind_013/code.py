**Dante Russo – "The Question" (Intro – 4 Bars in Dm, 160 BPM)**

---

### **Bar 1 (0.0 – 1.5s): Little Ray on Drums (Tension & Space)**

**Drums:**
- **Kick:** On beat 1 and 3, but with a slight delay on beat 3, as if uncertain.
- **Snare:** On beat 2 and 4, but with a sharp attack on beat 2 and a softer, almost ghosted hit on beat 4.
- **Hi-hat:** Open on beat 1, closed on 2, open on 3, closed on 4. But on beat 3, it’s open but *very* quiet—like a breath caught in the throat.
- **Cymbal:** A high, ghosted ride cymbal on beat 2, barely there.
- **Space:** The bar ends with a *pause*—no snare on beat 4, just a slight rimshot behind the kick, like a question left hanging.

### **Bars 2–4 (1.5 – 6.0s): Full Quartet (Emotion, Tension, Melody)**

**Sax (Dante):**
- **Bar 2:** Dm7 (D-F-A-C) – you play a short, searching phrase:  
  **D (quarter note) → F (eighth) → A (eighth) → rest**  
  The note A is played with a slight *fall*—like a memory resurfacing.  
  *That’s the question.*

- **Bar 3:** Chromatic approach to Cm7 (C-E♭-G-B♭) – you play:  
  **C (eighth) → B♭ (eighth) → E♭ (eighth) → rest**  
  You hold the E♭ a beat longer, as if it were a name you almost said aloud.  
  *That’s the doubt.*

- **Bar 4:** Dm7 again—this time, you play the same motif, but *quarter note on D*, and then a *half note on A*—  
  **D (quarter) → A (half)**  
  You hold that A, not as a resolution, but as a *pause before the storm*.  
  *That’s the answer… or maybe the beginning of the journey.*

**Bass (Marcus):**
- **Bar 2:** Chromatic walk: D → C → B → A  
- **Bar 3:** Chromatic walk: C → B♭ → A → G  
- **Bar 4:** Chromatic walk: B♭ → A → G → F  
- Every note is a step forward, but never the same twice. He’s been through this before. He knows the weight of the room.

**Piano (Diane):**
- **Bar 2:** Dm7 – D-F-A-C  
  But she plays it *sharp*, with a B♭ in the left hand, just under the D.  
  **Left hand:** B♭ (quarter)  
  **Right hand:** D-F-A-C (arpeggiated with urgency)  
  It’s not resolution—it’s *anger*.

- **Bar 3:** Cm7 – C-E♭-G-B♭  
  She plays it as if it’s a lament:  
  **Left hand:** E♭  
  **Right hand:** C-G-B♭ (chordal, with a dissonant tritone in between)  
  It’s *emotional*, not technical.

- **Bar 4:** Dm7 again, but she plays a *C7* in the right hand—  
  **C-E-G-B♭**  
  A dissonant clash. A *challenge*.

**Drums (Little Ray):**
- **Bar 2:** Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.  
  But he *pushes* the beat slightly on beat 3, like a heartbeat missing a beat.  
  Hi-hats are crisp, but not consistent—each eighth is slightly different.

- **Bar 3:** He falls behind the beat on 1, then plays a *brush stroke* on 2, then a *rim click* on 3.  
  The snare is delayed on 4, like a kick in the ribs.

- **Bar 4:** He *builds*, but doesn’t resolve.  
  Kick on 1, snare on 2, but on 3 and 4, it’s just a *clap*—not a drum.  
  It’s like a door slamming, but not closing.

### **The Moment:**
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He’s not here for the notes—he’s here for the *space*.  
For the question.  
For the silence between the bars.  
For the *searching* in the melody.  
For the *truth* in the tension.

This is not a song.  
This is the beginning of a story.  
And it starts with a question.

---

**End of Bar 4.**  
The room holds its breath.  
Dante looks up.  
The stage is silent.  
The answer is waiting.
