You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You’ve been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it’s 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She’s angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He’s sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he’s watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn’t heard before.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- Marcus: Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He's the anchor. His lines should move forward and never repeat.
- Diane: 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving. Use tension and release to support your melody.
- Little Ray: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar. Be precise, be full, but don’t overpower.
- You: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit. Let the silence speak.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.

Write a complete Python script using `pretty_midi` to generate a 4-bar intro that feels like it’s been waiting to be heard. Make it concise, expressive, and full of life. Let the rhythm breathe, let the melody linger, and make sure every instrument knows its role.

The best intros are those that feel complete in the space they occupy — they tell a story without needing to finish it. Every note should have a purpose, every silence should be meaningful, and every instrument should know its place and its voice.

Make the drums drive but never drown out the melody. Let the bass move like a heartbeat. Let the piano color without cluttering. And let your saxophone say something that hasn’t been said before — something that lingers, that invites the listener to follow.
