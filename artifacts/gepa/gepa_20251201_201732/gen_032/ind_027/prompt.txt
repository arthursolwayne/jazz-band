You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Here's the thing: Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- Marcus: Walking line (D2-G2, MIDI 38-43), roots and fifths with chromatic approaches, not scales. He's the anchor.
- Diane: Open voicings, different chord each bar, resolve on the last. Comp on 2 and 4.
- Little Ray: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar.
- You: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.

Generate a complete Python script:

```python
import pretty_midi

midi = pretty_midi.PrettyMIDI(initial_tempo=160)

# The quartet
sax = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=66)       # Dante
bass = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=33)      # Marcus
piano = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=0)      # Diane
drums = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=0, is_drum=True)  # Little Ray

# Drums: kick=36, snare=38, hihat=42

# Bar 1: Little Ray alone (0.0 - 1.5s)
# ONLY drums here. No piano, bass, or sax until bar 2.

# Bars 2-4: Full quartet (1.5 - 6.0s)

midi.instruments.extend([sax, bass, piano, drums])
```

Only output Python code. No explanations. Make Wayne lean forward.

BEST OUTPUT:
- The rhythm is tight, with no rests or unnecessary duration variations. The intro builds tension and anticipation, and the melody has a clear, emotional arc that feels fresh and personal.

WORST OUTPUT:
- The rhythm feels cluttered, with too many duration variations and rests that break the flow. The intro lacks focus and emotional direction, making it forgettable.

To ensure your output reflects the best possible outcome, focus on clarity, emotional storytelling, and rhythmic precision. The music should feel like a moment — not just a sequence of notes.
