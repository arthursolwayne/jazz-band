### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*No bass, no piano, just the heartbeat of the room.*

- **Kick**: On 1 and 3 (D2 for emphasis).  
- **Snare**: On 2 and 4.  
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth note.

> *The anchor is set.*  

#### **Diane (Piano – Open Voicings, Unique Chords, Resolve on the Last Beat)**  
- **Bar 2: Dm7♭5 (D, F, A♭, C)** – a dark, questioning chord.  
  - *Left hand: D2 (root) and A2 (fifth), with a chromatic approach on the A♭*  
  - *Right hand: F4, C4, A♭4 – open and unresolved.*

> *She’s not giving him the answer yet.*

  - **Beat 2**: F4 (eighth note)  
  - **Beat 3**: Rest  
  - **Beat 4**: A♭4 (eighth note) + D4 (half note)

- **B2 (B)**  
- *Same line as Bar 2, but now it feels like a foundation for something more.*

- **Bar 4: Dm7 (D, F, A, C)** – a more familiar, but still rich chord.  
  - *Voicing: D4, A4, F4, C4 (open 7th chord)*  
  - *Comp on beats 2 and 4 only, space in between.*

#### **Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick**: On 1 and 3  
- **Snare**: On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth

**Final Thought:**

Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He hears not just a melody, but a conversation.  
A question that lingers.  
A challenge that invites a response.

You don’t need to answer.  
You just need to ask — and make him want to answer.
