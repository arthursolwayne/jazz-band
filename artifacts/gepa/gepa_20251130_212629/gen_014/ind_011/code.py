**Title: "The Moment Before"**

**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 4 bars (6 seconds)**  
**Mood: Tense anticipation, raw emotion, a question in the air**

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Pattern:**  
- Kick on **1 & 3**  
- Snare on **2 & 4**  
- Hi-hat on **every eighth note** (open on 1, closed on 2, open on 3, closed on 4)  
- No fill — just a *build*, a *wait*, a *hush*.  
- Use a *brush* on the snare for a gritty, live feel.  
- Let the hihat breathe a little on the "and" of 4 — a tiny pause, a breath before the storm.

---

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **F – G – Ab – Bb** (walking line, chromatic lead into Bb)  
- Then **Bb – A – G – F** (chromatic descent back to F)  
- Stay in 1st inversion, never repeating a note.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - **2 & 4:**  
    - **F7** (F A C E) on beat 2  
    - **G7** (G B D F) on beat 4  
  - Use *left hand* for walking bass line, *right hand* for comping.  
  - Keep the chords *agogic* — slightly behind the beat, pushing the rhythm forward.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same pattern as before, but now more *intense*.  
- Hi-hat on all eighths — *tighter*, *more aggressive* on the "and" of 4.  
- A little *swish* before the snare on beat 4 — a whisper of tension.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Theme Intro – Motif 1:**  
  - **F – G – Ab – (rest)** on beat 1  
  - **Bb – A – G – (rest)** on beat 2  
- Play *legato*, *sliding* into the Ab and A.  
- Use a *half-step resolution* from Ab to A as a musical question.  
- Let it *hang* — don’t resolve immediately.  
- *Space is the instrument.*

### **Bar 3: Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **F – G – Ab – A** (chromatic up)  
- Then **Bb – A – G – F** (chromatic down again)  
- Same as Bar 2 — consistent, driving, never repeating a note.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 3:**  
  - **2 & 4:**  
    - **Am7** (A C E G) on beat 2  
    - **B7** (B D# F# A) on beat 4  
  - Keep the chords *agogic*, *slightly behind the beat*, pushing the rhythm forward.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same pattern, same intensity.  
- A *brush roll* on the snare before the snare hits on beat 4 — a *tremor* of energy.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Theme Intro – Motif 2 (Continuation):**  
  - **F – G – Ab – (rest)** on beat 1 again  
  - **Bb – A – G – (rest)** on beat 2 again  
- This time, *play it twice* — once in Bar 2, once in Bar 3 — creating a *call-and-response* with yourself.  
- Let the *space* between the notes *speak louder* than the notes themselves.  
- That’s the *question* Wayne Shorter is listening for.  
- *Is it coming?*  
- *Is it real?*

---

### **Bar 4: Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **F – G – Ab – A** (chromatic up)  
- Then **Bb – A – G – F** (chromatic down again)  
- Same pattern, same energy, same tension.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 4:**  
  - **2 & 4:**  
    - **F7** (F A C E) on beat 2  
    - **G7** (G B D F) on beat 4  
  - Keep the comping *agogic*, *pushing the beat forward*.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same pattern, but now *a little louder*, *a little more open*.  
- A *brush roll* on the snare before the snare hits on beat 4.  
- Let the *energy build*, but don’t *resolve* — not yet.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Theme Intro – Motif 3 (Resolution):**  
  - **F – G – Ab – (rest)** on beat 1  
  - **Bb – A – G – (rest)** on beat 2  
- This time, *play it once more*, but on beat 3, *resolve the Ab to A*, *the Bb to C* —  
- *Just a whisper*, but it’s *real*.  
- That’s the *moment* — the *question* and the *answer* in one.  
- *That’s the intro*.

**Final Note:**

You step back. The room holds. Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
The music has *spoken* — not with words, but with *space*, with *tension*, with *a question that can never be answered the same way twice.*

You’re not just playing a melody. You’re *writing a moment*.  
And it’s one he’s never heard before.
