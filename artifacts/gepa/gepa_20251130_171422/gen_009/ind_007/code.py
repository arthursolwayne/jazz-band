**Title: "Crimson Gate"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Length: 4 bars (6 seconds)**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar with tension, sparse but urgent.*

- **Kick:** 1, 3  
- **Snare:** 2, 4  
- **Hi-Hat:** 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & (closed)  
- **Fill:** At the end of the bar, a subtle *brush stroke* on the snare, just before the bass enters — a whisper of anticipation.

---

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. Anchor the harmony with F7 in root position.*

- **Notes (in F7):**  
  - **Beat 1:** F  
  - **Beat 2:** A♭ (chromatic approach to B♭)  
  - **Beat 3:** B♭  
  - **Beat 4:** D  
- **Phrasing:** Smooth, even, like a river.

---

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano – Comp):**  
*7th chords, comp on 2 and 4, stay out of the way but keep it moving.*

- **Beats 2 and 4:**  
  - **Beat 2:** B♭7 (B♭, D, F, A♭)  
  - **Beat 4:** F7 (F, A♭, C, E♭)  
- **Voicings:** Spread out, high register, echoing the bass line with subtle color.

---

**Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums – Continued):**  
*Same rhythm as Bar 1, but with a subtle increase in energy — a build-up.*

---

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax – Melody, Opening Motif):**  
*One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs.*

- **Notes (B♭ minor):**  
  - **Beat 1:** B♭  
  - **Beat 2:** D♭ (chromatic)  
  - **Beat 3:** E♭  
  - **Beat 4:** Open (rest)  
- **Phrasing:** Smooth, breathy, like a memory — a question. The last note is a whisper, not a cry.

---

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano – Comp):**  
*Same as Bar 2, but with a slight fermata on Beat 4 — a pause that echoes the saxophone’s silence.*

---

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Same line as Bar 2, but with a slight *push* on Beat 4 — a subtle tension.*

---

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax – Melody, Completion):**  
*Come back and finish the motif. Make it sing with emotional nuance.*

- **Notes (B♭ minor):**  
  - **Beat 1:** B♭  
  - **Beat 2:** D♭ (chromatic)  
  - **Beat 3:** E♭  
  - **Beat 4:** F (resolve to the tonic)  
- **Phrasing:** The same motif, but now finished. A full breath, a complete thought. The F at the end is a quiet, confident statement.

---

**Bar 4 – Diane (Piano – Comp):**  
*F7 on Beat 4 — a strong, full chord. No fermata this time. It’s resolved.*

**Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*F7, root position — a solid, grounding resolution.*

**Bar 4 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Same rhythm, but with an open snare hit on Beat 4 — a clean, concise finish.*

**End of Intro.**  
The room holds. Wayne Shorter leans forward. You feel his eyes.  
The rest of the song is the aftermath. This is the beginning.
