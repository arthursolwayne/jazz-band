---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**
- **Kick:** On 1 & 3
- **Snare:** On 2 & 4
- **Hi-hat:** On every 8th note (closed)
- **Fill:** None. Just the heartbeat, a steady pulse that feels like the air before a storm.

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chord:** Fmaj7 (F-A-C-E)  
- **Voicing:** Open, spread out – F in the left hand (MIDI 53), E in the right (MIDI 64)  
- **Comping:** Play the chord on beat 2, then a chromatic passing voicing on beat 4:  
  - Beat 2: Fmaj7 (F, A, C, E)  
  - Beat 4: Fmaj7 with a chromatic passing E → F (F, A, C, F)  
- **Feel:** Quiet, but clear. A hint of something unresolved.

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Walking line:** D2 (MIDI 38) → F2 (41) → G2 (43) → Bb2 (46)  
- **Rhythm:** Quarter notes, steady, no syncopation  
- **Play:** D2 on 1, F2 on 2, G2 on 3, Bb2 on 4  
- **Feel:** Anchor, grounded, but with a slight tension in that Bb

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:**  
  - **Beat 1:** F (MIDI 66) – long, open, like a question  
  - **Beat 2:** Bb (MIDI 62) – a slight twist, unexpected interval  
  - **Beat 3:** Rest – silence, space  
  - **Beat 4:** F (MIDI 66) – return to the question, but not the answer  
- **Phrasing:** Let the first note hang. Let the silence breathe.  
- **Feel:** Like the beginning of a story. Not a statement, but a suggestion.

### **Overall Feel:**  
This intro is **a question in F**, framed by the tension of a Bb and the silence of a rest. It’s not about resolution—it’s about **invitation**. The groove is tight, the space is intentional. Wayne Shorter is listening. You don’t have to answer. You just have to **open the door**.  

Play it like you mean it. Play it like you’re scared. That’s when it becomes real.
