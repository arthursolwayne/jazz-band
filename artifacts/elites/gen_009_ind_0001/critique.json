  "rationale": "The arrangement uses basic triads in the piano and bass parts (C, D, F, G) without 7th extensions or jazz harmony vocabulary. The rhythm section has a basic backbeat pattern with minimal syncopation, lacking the upbeat emphasis characteristic of Latin jazz. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop phrasing, chromaticism, or blues inflection. The trumpet is silent throughout, and there is no call-and-response between instruments. The overall feel is academic and lacks the improvisational spirit and sophistication of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz harmonic sophistication",
    "Add chromatic approach notes and blues inflections to the saxophone line for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in the hi-hat pattern and add syncopated accents on the snare for authentic Latin jazz groove",
    "Use walking bass lines with root-3rd-5th-7th motion instead of static root notes",
    "Add ii-V-I progressions in bars 3-4 for functional jazz harmony and create space for the trumpet to play"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
