### **Bars 2–4 – Full Ensemble**  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Bar 2:** Fm7♭5 → G♭7♭5 → A♭7♭5 → B♭7♭5  
  *Walking line, chromatic descent from F to B♭, never repeating a note.*  
- **Bar 3:** Cm7♭5 → D♭7♭5 → E♭7♭5 → Fm7♭5  
  *Chromatic ascent, pushing forward, tension rising.*  
- **Bar 4:** Fm7♭5 → G♭7♭5 → A♭7♭5 → B♭7♭5  
  *Returns to the original line, but with a slight shift in rhythm, holding on the last note.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - Comp on 2 and 4:  
    - **2:** Fm7♭5 (F, Ab, Db, E♭)  
    - **4:** Gm7♭5 (G, B♭, Eb, F)  
  - Voicing: Left hand rootless, right hand with a slight dissonance on the 4th beat (B♭ in the right hand).  
- **Bar 3:**  
  - Comp on 2 and 4:  
    - **2:** Cm7♭5 (C, Eb, G♭, B♭)  
    - **4:** Dm7♭5 (D, F, A♭, C)  
  - Adds a descending 7th chord in the right hand, slightly behind the beat.  
- **Bar 4:**

    - **2:** Fm7♭5 (F, Ab, Db, E♭)  
    - **4:** Gm7♭5 (G, B♭, Eb, F)  
  - Ends with a dissonant cluster on the last beat (F, Ab, B♭ in the right hand).  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Bars 2–4:**  
  - Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
  - On the **“and of 3”** in Bar 3, a quick brush on the snare, like a whisper.  
  - On the last beat of Bar 4, a subtle rimshot, like a gasp.  

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - Play this short motif:  
    **F – Ab – B♭ – (rest)**  
    *Smooth legato, with a slight upward inflection on B♭, like a question.*  
- **Bars 3–4:**  
  - **Bar 3:**  
    **C – Eb – F – (rest)**  
    *Same shape, transposed up a fifth, but with a slight delay on the “F,” creating tension.*  
  - **Bar 4:**  
    **F – Ab – B♭ – (rest)**  
    *Return to the original motif, but this time, on the last rest, you hold the breath, leave it open.*

**End of 4 Bars.**  
Silence hangs.  
The room is still.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He’s heard something that hasn’t been played before.  
You didn’t just play a motive — you opened a door.  

Now, the rest of the set is just the echo of that moment.
