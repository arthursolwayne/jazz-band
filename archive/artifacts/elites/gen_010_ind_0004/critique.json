  "rationale": "This 8-bar arrangement uses only triads (capped jazz_harmony at 3/10) and lacks 7th chords or extensions, making the harmony sound academic. The hihat plays in a straight 16th-note pattern with no emphasis on upbeats (capped latin_jazz_rhythm at 3/10), resulting in a straight-time feel rather than Latin jazz. The saxophone melody consists of repetitive scalar patterns with no phrasing or development (4/10), and all instruments start playing in bar 1 with no progressive build (interplay_space capped at 4/10). The arrangement lacks swing, blues feel, and jazz idioms, sounding more like a generic MIDI template than authentic jazz (4/10). Major improvements are needed in harmony, rhythm, and arrangement structure.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Bar 1: ONLY hihat should play. All other instruments rest.",
    "Bars 2-4: Add snare and bass. Piano and sax still rest.",
    "Bars 5-8: Full ensemble enters with piano 7th chords and memorable sax melody.",
    "Replace ALL piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7: C-E-G-B, Dm7: D-F-A-C)",
    "Increase hihat upbeat syncopation to >60% (hit more 'and's, skip more downbeats)"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize progressive arrangement structure more strongly. Add quantitative requirements: Bar 1 = hihat ONLY, Bars 2-4 = rhythm section ONLY (no piano/sax), Bars 5-8 = full ensemble. Make it impossible to ignore."
