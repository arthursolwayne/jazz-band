  "rationale": "This arrangement uses basic triads in the piano and bass parts (C, D, G, A, etc.) without 7th extensions, making the harmony sound more like a beginner exercise than jazz. The rhythm section has a basic backbeat with some hihat activity but lacks the syncopation and swing feel characteristic of Latin jazz. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The trumpet is silent throughout, and there's minimal interplay between instruments. The overall feel is academic and lacks the spontaneity and sophistication of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes to saxophone lines for bebop flavor and sophistication",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in the hihat pattern and add syncopation to the snare for a more authentic Latin jazz feel",
    "Use walking bass lines with roots, 3rds, 5ths, and 7ths instead of just root notes",
    "Add ii-V-I progressions in bars 3-4 for authentic jazz harmony and structure"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
