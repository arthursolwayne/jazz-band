---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Fill:** A subtle, half-time ghost note on the "and" of 3, building tension before the ensemble enters. The cymbal swells slightly, like the first breath before a storm.

### **Bar 2 – Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Beat 1:** D (root)  
- **Beat 2:** C (chromatic lower)  
- **Beat 3:** D (root)  
- **Beat 4:** F (chromatic upper)  
*Walking line, precise, with subtle chromatic movement that suggests a question, not an answer.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Beat 2:** B♭7 chord (Dm7 with a raised 9)  
- **Beat 4:** G7 chord (Dm7 → G7)  
*Sparse, emotionally charged, with a sense of urgency. She’s not just comping — she’s asking a question.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Continues the same pattern, now with a slight push on the 3rd beat, giving the music a forward motion.

### **Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif (Starting on beat 1):**  
- **Beat 1:** E♭ (melodic minor, 3rd of Dm)  
- **Beat 2:** D (root)  
- **Beat 3:** F (chromatic upper)  
- **Beat 4:** E♭ (returning, unresolved)  
*You play the motif with a breathy, almost whispered tone. It’s haunting, not loud. It leaves the room hanging. It’s a question — not an answer. It’s the moment before the storm.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Ensemble Completes the Intro**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Beat 1:** D  
- **Beat 2:** C  
- **Beat 3:** D  
- **Beat 4:** F# (chromatic upper, leading to G)  
*The bass moves toward resolution, but it’s still cautious. It’s not rushing.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Beat 2:** G7 again, but this time with a diminished 9 (B♭)  
- **Beat 4:** G7 with a suspended 4 (C)  
*She leans into the tension, leaving the resolution just out of reach.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- On beat 4, a snare roll that swells into a cymbal crash — the storm begins to break. But not yet. Just a hint.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Beat 1:** You repeat the motif, but with a slight delay, as if answering your own question.  
- **Beat 4:** A half-step resolution — C natural instead of C# — to keep the mystery alive.

### **Final Moment:**

The room holds its breath for a second — the silence after the music. Then, the next chord falls.

**Wayne Shorter leans forward.**

He’s heard something he didn’t expect — and it’s not over yet.

Let the storm begin.
