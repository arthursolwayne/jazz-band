**Title: *The Question at 2:00*  
Key: F Major  
Tempo: 160 BPM  
Time Signature: 4/4  
Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3 (subtle, muted).  
- Snare on beat 2 and 4 (dry, crisp).  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note (closed, light, behind the beat).  
- **At the end of the bar**, a soft, open hi-hat on the "and" of 4, like a breath held.

> *The room holds. The silence is not empty. It's waiting.*

---

**Bar 2: Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line in F**  
- F – G – Ab – A  
- Bb – B – C – D  
- Eb – E – F – G  
- Ab – A – Bb – B  

> *Marcus walks with a question in his step — chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He’s the anchor but also the thread pulling the melody forward.*

---

**Bar 2: Diane (Piano) – Comping on 2 and 4**  
- **Beat 2**: F7 (F A C Eb)  
- **Beat 4**: Bb7 (Bb D F Ab)  
- *Left hand: Walking bass line, but with a twist — a chromatic descent on the "and" of 2 and 4.*

> *Diane’s chords are sharp, angry, but they’re not in your way. They’re pushing the story forward.*

---

**Bar 2: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Same as before, but with a subtle cymbal wash on the "and" of 2 and 4, like a whisper.

---

**Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax) – Melody**  
- **Beat 1**: F (long, open, held)  
- **Beat 2**: G (half note, smooth, drifting)  
- **Beat 3**: Ab (quarter note, sudden, unexpected)  
- **Beat 4**: Rest (no sound, silence, tension)  

> *Your first note is the question. The rest is the pause that makes the room wait. You don’t answer yet — you leave it hanging.*

---

**Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) – Melody (Continued)**  
- **Beat 1**: A (half note, a step forward, but still unresolved)  
- **Beat 2**: Bb (quarter note, like a memory just out of reach)  
- **Beat 3**: C (quarter note, a hint of light)  
- **Beat 4**: F (quarter note, a return to home — but not quite the same F)**

> *You finish the motif. You return to F, but not the same F. It’s unfamiliar. It’s like a dream you can’t place. You’ve asked the question. Now he’s listening.*

---

**Bar 4: Diane (Piano), Marcus (Bass), Little Ray (Drums)**  
- All follow your lead, echoing the motif with slight variations, building tension in the air.

> *The room is alive. Wayne Shorter is leaning forward.*

---

**End of Intro.**

> *You’ve made the question. Now, you wait to see if anyone answers.*
