**Tempo: 160 BPM, 4/4 time**  
**Bars: 4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds**  

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Pattern:**  
- Kick on **1** and **3**, snare on **2** and **4**, hihat on every eighth.  
- Play the first bar with **deliberate restraint**.  
- No cymbal crashes, no fills — just a slow, **tense pulse**.  
- Let the silence between the hits **breathe**.  
- The snare on the “&” of 2 and the “&” of 4 adds **subtle tension**.  
- The kick is low, like a **heartbeat**.

---

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters**  

#### **Marcus (Bass):**  
- **D2** (root) → **F#2** (minor 3rd) → **G2** (fifth) → **C#2** (chromatic approach to D)  
- A walking line that **moves towards** the melody, but doesn’t yet resolve.  
- Chromatic motion from C#2 to D2 adds a **sense of yearning**.

#### **Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chord: Dm7 (D-F-A-C)**  
- Open voicing: **D (left hand) + F, A, C (right hand)**  
- **Comp on the 2nd and 4th beats**, soft and **spacious**.  
- Let the chord **linger** just a fraction too long — like a memory that won’t fade.

#### **You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **D (1st beat)** — a long, **sighing note**  
  - **F (2nd beat)** — a **descending half-step**, full of tension  
  - **G (3rd beat)** — **sustained**, like a memory half-remembered  
  - **C (4th beat)** — **held open**, unresolved, aching  
- One short motif. Make it **sing on the edge of silence**.  
- Don’t close it. Leave it **hanging** — like something just out of reach.

### **Bar 3: Full Ensemble**  

#### **Marcus (Bass):**  
- **F#2** (minor 3rd) → **A2** (fifth) → **B2** (chromatic approach to C) → **C2** (root)  
- A walking line that **moves away** from the root, then **resolves to C2** on the last beat.  
- The chromatic motion from B2 to C2 gives a **sense of arrival**.

#### **Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chord: Bm7 (B-D-F#-A)**  
- Open voicing: **B (left) + D, F#, A (right)**  
- Again, comp on the **2nd and 4th beats**, but now the **chord is darker, more urgent**.  
- Let the **F# ring out** — it’s the **heart of the melody**.

#### **You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **B (1st beat)** — a **half-step above the last note**, like a memory returning  
  - **D (2nd beat)** — **sustained**, echoing the piano  
  - **F# (3rd beat)** — a **rising note**, almost reaching  
  - **A (4th beat)** — **held**, but not resolved — still **open**  
- The melody is **not closing**, it’s **reaching**.

### **Bar 4: Full Ensemble**  

#### **Marcus (Bass):**  
- **C2** (root) → **D2** (minor 9th) → **F2** (minor 3rd) → **G2** (fifth)  
- A **walking line that returns to the home key**, but with a **twist** — a **chromatic climb** up to G2.  
- It feels like **you’re almost there**, but not quite.

#### **Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chord: Gm7 (G-Bb-D-F)**  
- Open voicing: **G (left) + Bb, D, F (right)**  
- Comp on the **2nd and 4th beats**, but with **a little dissonance** in the Bb.  
- Let the **F ring out** — a **glimpse of resolution**, but **not the full thing**.

#### **You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **G (1st beat)** — the **first full note of the motif**, but now **in the new key**  
  - **Bb (2nd beat)** — a **half-step descent**, a contrast to the last bar  
  - **D (3rd beat)** — now **resolved**, but still **aching**  
  - **F (4th beat)** — **sustained, soft**, like the **last breath of a memory**  
- You **finish the phrase**, but not with a **smile** — with a **question**.

**End of 4 bars.**  
**Silence.**  
The room holds.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
It's not what he expected.  
It's what he needed.
