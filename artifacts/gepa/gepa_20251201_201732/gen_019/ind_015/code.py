**Title: "Whisper in the Dark"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Time: 6 seconds**  

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Snare on 2 and 4, kick on 1 and 3, hihat on every eighth. The fill is subtle — a half-time roll under the snare on beat 4, like a breath held before speaking.*  

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble In**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
F2 – G2 – F2 – E2 (walking line, with a chromatic approach to E2)  
*He plays the root (F), fifth (C), back to root, and a half-step down to E2 — a tension before resolution.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
*Open voicing on beat 2: C7 (C-E-G-B♭)  
Then, on beat 4: E7 (E-G#-B-D) – a chromatic shift, unresolved, like a question.*  
*She plays only on beats 2 and 4, with a bossa nova comp feel, but with a dark edge, like a storm gathering.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Same as Bar 1, but with a slight accent on the ride cymbal on beat 3 — a subtle push forward.*

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Your motif begins — a single phrase, short, urgent, and unresolved.*  
**Notes (in F major, with a blue tinge):**  
F – G – E♭ – D  
*Play it with a breathy, whispery tone — like a memory surfacing. End on D, not resolving to C, just holding the tension.*

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*You repeat the first two notes of the motif, but now you leave it hanging.*  
**Notes:**  
F – G – (hold)  
*Let the note ring, a suspended D, with a little vibrato — like a question in the dark. No resolution, just presence.*  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
F2 – C2 – F2 – D2 (chromatic approach to D2)  
*He’s still walking, but now the line is subtle, like a heartbeat in the distance.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
*On beat 2: A7 (A-C#-E-G) — a sudden shift, a storm breaking.*  
*On beat 4: F7 (F-A-C-E) — a return to home, but with a twist. She resolves, but only briefly.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
*A final fill — snare on 2 and 4, kick on 1 and 3, but with a slight rubato on beat 4, like the end of a sentence that lingers.*

**Final Moment:**  
You hold the D, and the room holds with you. The air is thick with possibility. Wayne Shorter leans forward. This is your moment. You don’t need to finish it. You’ve already said something that matters.
