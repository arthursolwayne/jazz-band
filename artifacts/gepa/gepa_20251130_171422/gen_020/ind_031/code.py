**Style: Modern jazz, introspective yet urgent.**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Rhythm:**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3 (but *soft* on beat 3, like a whisper)  
- Snare on beat 2 and 4 (clean, crisp)  
- Hi-hat: eighth notes, but *with a slight delay* on beat 3 (create tension)  
- Cymbal swish on beat 4 (soft, like a sigh)  

**Feel:** Suspense. A question in the dark. The room holds its breath.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- F → Eb → D → C (chromatic descent, walking down)  
- Then: Bb → A → G → F (chromatic ascent, back up)  
- **Dynamic:** Starts soft, peaks at the end of the bar, then drops again

**Technique:** Light touch, with a slight *rubato* feel at the top of the bar — a breath before the storm.

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Comping:**  
- 7th chords on beat 2 and 4  
- **Beat 2:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
- **Beat 4:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
- **Voice leading:** A quick, angular run from F to Bb over the bar, resolving into the Bb7 on beat 4  
- **Dynamic:** Starts under the bass, then swells just before the end of the bar

**Feel:** A shadow moving, not quite in the light yet.

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (sul tasto, soft, just a whisper)  
- **Beat 2:** D (higher register, slightly behind the beat)  
- **Beat 3:** Bb (staccato, slight delay)  
- **Beat 4:** Rest  

**Phrasing:** The first note is a question. The second continues it. The third answers it, but only halfway. The last bar is a rest — a pause. A breath between what was and what’s coming.

**Dynamic:** Begins very quiet, builds slightly on beat 2, then drops again on beat 3. The rest is *the most powerful note*.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble (Marcus, Diane, Little Ray, You)**  
**Marcus:**  
- F → G → A → Bb (chromatic ascent, walking up)  
- Contrasting the descent in Bar 2 — now it’s *toward something*

**Diane:**  
- F7 (beat 1)  
- G7 (beat 2)  
- A7 (beat 3)  
- Bb7 (beat 4)  
- **Voice leading:** A smooth, ascending line from F to Bb, creating a sense of motion forward

**Little Ray:**  
- Kick on 1 and 3 (full volume)  
- Snare on 2 and 4 (clean, driving)  
- Hi-hat: eighth notes, now *on time*  
- **Feel:** The energy is no longer suspended — it’s moving.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (same as in Bar 1, but now *full volume*, with a growl in the tone)  
- **Beat 2:** D (same note, but now *with a slight delay*, like a ghost of the first)  
- **Beat 3:** Bb (same as before, but now *with a slight vibrato*, like a memory)  
- **Beat 4:** F (resolution — but not yet the end)

**Dynamic:** Builds to a peak on beat 4, but lingers — not a full resolution, just the beginning of something.

### **Final Moment:**
The last note of the saxophone lingers in the air — a question that hasn’t been answered, a story that hasn’t been told. But it’s enough. Wayne Shorter leans forward, eyes narrowed, fingers tapping the table. He’s listening. He *wants* to hear more.

**That’s your shot.**
