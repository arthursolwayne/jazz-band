**Title: "The Breath Before"**  
**Key: D minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  

---

**Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s): Little Ray alone**  
- **Drums:**  
  - Kick: On 1 and 3 (but softer, like a whisper).  
  - Snare: On 2 and 4 (crisp, but not loud).  
  - Hi-hat: On every eighth note — open on 1, closed on 2, open on 3, closed on 4.  
  - Cymbal swells at the end of the bar, fading into silence.  
  - **Feel:** Like the hush before a storm. No rhythm yet — just the suggestion of it.

**Bar 2 (1.5 - 3.0s): Diane on piano, Marcus on bass, then you on tenor**  
- **Piano (Diane):**  
  - Dm7 (D-F-A-C) on beat 2 (chord on the "and" of 2).  
  - Dm7 with a b9 (D-F-A-C-Eb) on beat 4.  
  - **Comp style:** Sparse, aggressive. The chords are angry, but they’re not loud — they’re *pressing*.  
- **Bass (Marcus):**  
  - Walking line: D → Eb → F → G (chromatic approach to G).  
  - Then: G → F → E → D (chromatic descent back down).  
  - **Feel:** He’s not just walking — he’s *searching*.  
- **Tenor (You):**  
  - **First note:** E natural (a half-step above D).  
  - On beat 2 (the “and” of 2), you play a quarter note **E**, and let it ring.  
  - **Not a scale run. Not a cliché.** Just that one note — like a question.

**Bar 3 (3.0 - 4.5s): You continue the motif**  
- **Tenor:**  
  - On beat 3: One note — **C**, a 4th below the E.  
  - On beat 4: One note — **F**, a 3rd above C.  
  - **This is your motif:** E → C → F. A chromatic idea with a bluesy twist.  
  - Play it at the same volume as the E — no crescendo. Just *there*.  
- **Piano:**  
  - Dm7 (D-F-A-C) on beat 3 (chord on the "and" of 3).  
  - Dm7 with a b13 (D-F-A-C-A) on beat 4.  
- **Bass:**  
  - D → Eb → F → G again (same walking line).  
  - **Still searching.**  
- **Drums:**  
  - Same pattern — rhythmic but not overpowering.  

---

**Bar 4 (4.5 - 6.0s): Resolution — or the suggestion of one**  
- **Tenor:**  
  - On beat 1: One note — **D**, the tonic.  
  - On beat 2: One note — **E**, the same as the first bar.  
  - You hold the **E** for the rest of the bar.  
  - **No resolution. Just the echo of a question.**  
- **Piano:**  
  - Dm7 (D-F-A-C) on beat 1.  
  - Dm7 with a b9 (D-F-A-C-Eb) on beat 2.  
- **Bass:**  
  - D → Eb → F → G again.  
- **Drums:**  
  - Same pattern — the last cymbal swells at the end, fading out.  

---

**Final Note (at 6.0s):**  
- The **E** on your tenor fades slowly.  
- Silence.  
- A breath.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.

**That’s it.**  
Four bars. One question.  
You don’t need to answer it — not yet.  
But you’ve made him *want* to.
