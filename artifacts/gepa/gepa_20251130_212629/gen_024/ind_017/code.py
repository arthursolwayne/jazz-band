---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3. Snare on 2 and 4. Hi-hat on every eighth.  
*Subtle, but full. The room holds its breath.*  

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
| D# – C – B – A |  
| F – E – D – C |  
*Walking line, chromatic approach to D. A question in the low end.*  

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4:  
**2:** Dm7 (D – F – A – C)  
**4:** G7 (G – B – D – F)  
*Dark and open. Space where the melody can grow.*  

**Bar 2 – You (Sax):**  
**Melody (Tenor Sax):**  
*Phrase starts with a breath.*  
**D – C – B – A (quarter notes, held with space between each)**  
*Let the silence speak. The question is in the air.*

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
| G – F – E – D |  
| C – B – A – G |  
*Still walking, but now it’s a memory. The line moves with purpose, not repetition.*  

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4:  
**2:** Cm7 (C – Eb – G – Bb)  
**4:** F7 (F – A – C – Eb)  
*The tension shifts. A suggestion of where the story might go.*  

**Bar 3 – You (Sax):**  
**Melody (Tenor Sax):**  
**G – F – E – D (quarter notes, same phrasing as Bar 2, but a half step lower)**  
*The memory returns. A reply to the question. Still not the answer — just the echo.*

**Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass):**  
| A – G – F – E |  
| D – C – B – A |  
*The line resolves, but not fully. It's heading toward something.*  

**Bar 4 – Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4:  
**2:** Bm7 (B – D – F# – A)  
**4:** E7 (E – G# – B – D)  
*The final pivot. The room is leaning forward now.*  

**Bar 4 – You (Sax):**  
**Melody (Tenor Sax):**  
**A – G – F – E (quarter notes, same phrasing) — then a rest on the last beat (beat 4).**  
*Let it hang. The story isn’t over yet. It’s just beginning.*

**Final Note:**  
You leave the last note suspended — a whisper, not a shout. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The room is silent. You’ve made him listen.
