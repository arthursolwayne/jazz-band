You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Here's the thing: Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- Marcus: Walking line (D2-G2, MIDI 38-43), roots and fifths with chromatic approaches, not scales. He's the anchor.
- Diane: Open voicings, different chord each bar, resolve on the last. Comp on 2 and 4.
- Little Ray: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar.
- You: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.

Generate a complete Python script using pretty_midi that creates a 4-bar intro with the following qualities:

- The first bar should be atmospheric and mysterious, using only the drums to build tension. The rhythm should feel urgent but incomplete, as if something is waiting to happen.
- The second bar introduces the full ensemble, with the piano clearly outlining the harmony, the bass walking with purpose, and the drums continuing to drive the rhythm forward.
- Your saxophone melody should begin in the third bar. It should be concise, melodic, and emotionally charged. It should suggest a narrative without resolving it completely, leaving space for the listener to imagine what comes next.
- Every instrument has a clear and distinct role. No instrument should sound like another. The texture should be rich but never muddy.
- There should be rhythmic variety and dynamic contrast between the first bar and the rest. The music should feel like it was born in the dark, but it knows where it's going.

Let the music breathe. Make every note count. Make it sound like it was born in the dark, but it knows where it's going.
