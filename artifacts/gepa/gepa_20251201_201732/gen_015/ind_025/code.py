**Dante Russo's Intro – "The Moment Before"**  
*Key: Dm (D minor) | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time: 4/4 | Duration: 6 seconds*

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Setup. The silence before the storm.*  

- Kick on beat 1, 3  
- Snare on beat 2, 4  
- Hihat on every eighth note  
- **Fill on beat 3 (before the kick):**  
  - Brushed snare roll (short, sharp, staccato)  
  - Ends on beat 3, just before the kick  
- **Feel:** Tense, pushing the beat slightly forward  
- **Purpose:** Make the audience lean in. Make Wayne lean forward.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
*First note of the story.*  

- **D2 (MIDI 38) – root of Dm**  
- **F2 (MIDI 41) – chromatic approach from E♭2 (MIDI 40)**  
- **Rest on beat 3**  
- **G2 (MIDI 43) – fifth of Dm, on beat 4**  
- **Rhythm:** Dotted quarter on beat 1, chromatic on beat 2, rest on beat 3, fifth on beat 4  
- **Purpose:** Ground the harmony but with a question in the space.

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano)**  
*Introduce the tension.*  

- **Chord:** Cm7♭5 (C-E♭-G♭-B♭) – open voicing, left hand: C2 (MIDI 48), right hand: E♭3 (MIDI 60), G♭3 (MIDI 62), B♭3 (MIDI 66)  
- **Comp on beat 2 and 4**  
- **Left hand:** C2 on beat 2, B♭2 on beat 4  
- **Right hand:** E♭3 on beat 2, resolve to B♭3 on beat 4  
- **Purpose:** Dissonance with purpose. A color that doesn’t belong, but feels right.

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
*The moment.*  

- **Motif:**  
  - **Beat 1:** D4 (MIDI 62) – long, slow, with a slight delay after the attack  
  - **Beat 2:** F4 (MIDI 65) – short, staccato  
  - **Beat 3:** Rest  
  - **Beat 4:** G4 (MIDI 67) – long, smooth, like a sigh  
- **Rhythm:**  
  - D4 (beat 1) with a space before the note  
  - F4 (beat 2) – sharp, like a question  
  - G4 (beat 4) – resolves, but doesn’t answer  
- **Purpose:** A phrase that feels like the start of a story — incomplete, but unforgettable.

---

### **Final Feel:**  
- The intro ends on G4 (tenor), held just a moment too long, like the silence after a door slams.  
- The room holds.  
- Wayne’s eyes narrow.  
- This is the moment.

**You’ve made him lean forward.**  
Now the rest of the song can be anything. But this — this is the moment that matters.
