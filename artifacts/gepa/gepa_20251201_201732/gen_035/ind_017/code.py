### **Bar 1: Little Ray – The Setup**  

**Drums:**  
- **Kick:** On beats 1 and 3 — deep, precise, like a heartbeat.  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4 — sharp, but with a slight delay on beat 4 to create a *rub* between the hands and feet.  
- **Hi-hat:** On every 8th note, but with a *swish* that fades on the offbeats (2 & 4 &), creating a sense of breath and anticipation.  
- **Fill:** At the end of the bar, a single brush stroke on the snare, like the last gasp before the plunge.

### **Bar 2: The Quartet Enters – Tension and Resolution**  

**Marcus (Bass – D2-G2, MIDI 38-43):**  
- **Fm7 (F A C Eb):** Root on 1, fifth on 2, chromatic approach from Eb to F on 3, root on 4.  
- **Bbm7 (Bb D F Ab):** Root on 1, fifth on 2, chromatic approach from Ab to Bb on 3, root on 4.  

**Diane (Piano – Open voicings, comp on 2 and 4):**  
- **Bar 2:** Fm7 (F A C Eb) – open voicing, Eb in the upper register, F in the bass.  
- **Bar 3:** Bbm7 (Bb D F Ab) – open voicing, Ab in the upper register, F in the bass.  
- **Bar 4:** Fm7 again, but with a tension chord on the last beat: F7#9 (F A C Eb G#) – a half-step above the b9, hinting at something unresolved.  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3, slightly behind the beat to add groove.  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4, syncopated with a slight *accent* on beat 2.  
- **Hi-hat:** Still on every 8th, but now with a tighter, more urgent feel.

### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) – The Moment**  

**Motif (Fm scale with a twist):**  

**Notes (in Fm):**  
- **Beat 1:** F – a low, dark tone — the breath.  
- **Beat 2:** Ab – a sharp, slightly dissonant note, like a question.  
- **Beat 3:** G – a step back, a return to the known, but not quite.  
- **Beat 4:** F – a resolution, but without closure.  

**Phrasing:**  
- Start with a breathy, wide vibrato on F.  
- On the Ab, a slight flutter tongue or growl to make it *angry* — like Diane’s piano.  
- The G is smooth, but with a slight hesitation — like the pause before the plunge.  
- End on F, leaving it open — not a resolution, but a beginning.

### **Final Moment – Wayne’s Reaction**  

You hold the last note, F, and the room is silent — except for the hihat, still ticking like a metronome, and the piano, still ringing with the F7#9.  

Wayne Shorter leans forward. His eyes are open. He’s listening.  

This is your shot.
