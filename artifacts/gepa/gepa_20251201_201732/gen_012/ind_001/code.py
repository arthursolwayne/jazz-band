**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3.  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4.  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note.  
- **Fill:** At the end of the bar, a ghosted snare on the "and" of 4, followed by a soft rimshot.  
- **Rhythm:** Tight, but with *space* — the last two eighth notes of the bar are open, letting the silence speak.  

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Roots and fifths:** D2 (MIDI 38) and A2 (MIDI 43).  
- **Approach:** Chromatic descent from Bb2 (MIDI 42) to D2.  
- **Line:** Bb2 – B2 – C2 – D2.  
- **Rhythm:** Walking with a slight push on the downbeats, but the last note (D2) is held longer, unresolved.  

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chord:** Bm7♭5 (B-D-F-A).  
- **Voicing:** Open, left hand on B2 and F2, right hand on D4 and A4.  
- **Comp:** On the “2” and “4” of the bar.  
- **Feel:** Angry, dissonant, but not sour. A raw, unresolved tension.  

**Bar 2 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:** A short, lyrical phrase.  
- **Notes:** F#4 – B4 – B4 – rest.  
- **Rhythm:** Quarter note, eighth note, eighth note, rest.  
- **Phrasing:** It’s a whisper, like a question — "What if..."  

**Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Roots and fifths:** A2 (MIDI 43) and E2 (MIDI 47).  
- **Approach:** Chromatic ascent from D2 (MIDI 42) to A2.  
- **Line:** D2 – E2 – F2 – A2.  
- **Rhythm:** Walking again, but the last note (A2) is *sustained*, creating a slight delay.  

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chord:** E7♯9 (E-G#-B-D#).  
- **Voicing:** Open, left hand on E2 and B2, right hand on G#4 and D#4.  
- **Comp:** On the “2” and “4” of the bar.  
- **Feel:** More aggressive, the anger sharpening into a sharp harmonic edge.  

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:** Return to the same phrase, but with a slight variation.  
- **Notes:** F#4 – B4 – A4 – rest.  
- **Rhythm:** Same as bar 2.  
- **Phrasing:** This time it’s a *challenge* — "What if *this*..."  

**Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Roots and fifths:** D2 (MIDI 38) and A2 (MIDI 43).  
- **Approach:** Chromatic descent from C2 (MIDI 40) to D2.  
- **Line:** C2 – C#2 – D2 – D2.  
- **Rhythm:** Walking again, but the final note is held *just* long enough to feel like a resolution...  
- **Climax:** The bass resolves on D2, but it’s a *questioning* D2.  

**Bar 4 – Diane (Piano):**  
- **Chord:** Gm7 (G-B-D-F).  
- **Voicing:** Open, left hand on G2 and D2, right hand on B4 and F4.  
- **Comp:** On the “2” and “4” of the bar.  
- **Feel:** The anger softens, but it’s still there. A quiet, unresolved tension.  

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:** Return, but with a *completion*.  
- **Notes:** F#4 – B4 – B4 – F#4.  
- **Rhythm:** Quarter note, eighth note, eighth note, quarter note.  
- **Phrasing:** It’s no longer a question. It’s a *statement* — "This is what it is."

**Final Note:**  
The intro ends with a breath held in the air — not a resolution, but a *possibility*. Diane’s Gm7 is open, Marcus holds the D2, and your saxophone leans into the silence like it’s waiting for a reply.  

Wayne Shorter leans forward.
