**"Breath Before the Leap"**  
**Key: Dm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Pattern:**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3  
- Snare on beat 2 and 4  
- Hihat on every eighth note  
- **At the end of the bar**, a **rest** on the last eighth note (beat 4, 8th note)  
- **Space is the key here.** The last hit is delayed by 1/8th, creating a tension that the rest of the band waits to resolve.

**Rhythmic tension:** The hihat is consistent, but the kick and snare are precise. The final hihat on beat 4 is left hanging — almost like a question mark.

### **Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Dm7 (D F A C)**  
- Downbeat: **D**  
- **Chromatic approach to F**: D → Eb → F  
- **Walking line**:  
  D – Eb – F – G (beat 1)  
  A – Bb – B – C (beat 2)  
  D – Eb – F – G (beat 3)  
  A – Bb – B – C (beat 4)  
- **No repeated notes**, always moving.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on 2 and 4**, 7th chords  
- **Bar 2, beat 2:** **Gm7 (G Bb D F)**  
- **Bar 2, beat 4:** **Cm7 (C Eb G Bb)**  
- **Voice leading** from the previous bar, avoiding parallel fifths or anything predictable.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif begins on beat 2**, one note — **F#** (a half-step above the 3rd of Dm)  
- **Rhythmic placement:**  
  - **Beat 2 (quarter note):** F#  
  - **Beat 3 (eighth note):** rest  
  - **Beat 4 (eighth note):** rest  
- **No scale run**, just one note — but it's a **dissonant, unresolved note** that lingers.

### **Bar 3 – Continue Full Band**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Continues the walking line perfectly**, never repeating a note from bar 2  
- **Bar 3, beat 1:** G  
- **Bar 3, beat 2:** A  
- **Bar 3, beat 3:** Bb  
- **Bar 3, beat 4:** B

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp with a Dm7 (D F A C)** on beat 1  
- **Bar 3, beat 2:** F7 (F A C Eb)  
- **Bar 3, beat 4:** Gm7 (G Bb D F)  
- **Still moving forward**, but with a slight **tension** on the F7

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Beat 1:** rest  
- **Beat 2:** C (the 7th of Dm)  
- **Beat 3:** rest  
- **Beat 4:** rest  
- **That C** is a **color note** — it's part of the chord, but it's **not the root or the 3rd**, it’s the **7th**. It's **singing**, but it’s not answering the question yet.

### **Bar 4 – Climax of the Intro**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Bar 4, beat 1:** C (the 7th)  
- **Bar 4, beat 2:** D (the root)  
- **Bar 4, beat 3:** E (the 9th)  
- **Bar 4, beat 4:** F (the 3rd)  
- **Walks into the tonic**, but with **unexpected extensions**, creating **a sense of arrival** that feels **just off**.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 4, beat 1:** Dm7  
- **Bar 4, beat 2:** G7  
- **Bar 4, beat 4:** Cm7  
- **A ii-V-i progression**, but with a **twist** — the Cm7 is not the expected Dm7. **It’s a question.** Where are we going?

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Beat 1:** rest  
- **Beat 2:** D (the root of Dm)  
- **Beat 3:** rest  
- **Beat 4:** rest  
- **That D is the root** — the **anchor**, the **starting point**, but it’s **left hanging**. It's not a resolution, it's a **setup**. A **breath before the leap**.

---

### **Final Feel:**
- **Rhythmic tension and release** from Ray’s delayed last hit  
- **Space and rests** in every section — especially in your line  
- **A question, not a statement** — the intro ends with a **D**, but no resolution  
- **Unique durations and rhythmic placement** — no predictable patterns  
- **Lingers in the air** like a shadow just before a flame
