### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hats:** On every eighth note

### **Bar 2: Ensemble Enters**  
- **Marcus (Bass):**  
  - D2 (MIDI 38) on beat 1  
  - Chromatic approach to Fm7: C#2 (MIDI 41) on "and" of 2

  - Played on beat 2 (downbeat of bar 2)  
  - **Bar 3:** **Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)** — unexpected, creates a ii-V feel  
  - **Bar 4:** **Am7 (A, C, E, G)** — resolves to a minor key with a hint of Dorian  
  - **Comping:** Sparse, emotional, chords on 2 and 4 only  
  - **Left hand:** Walking line (same rhythm as bass, but with color)  
  - **Right hand:** Chordal, open, with a touch of rubato on the last note of each chord

- **Little Ray (Drums):**  
  - Kick on 1 and 3  
  - Snare on 2 and 4

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax) — First Motif**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **Bar 3, beat 1:** F (root) — short, clean, held on the beat  
  - **Bar 3, beat 2:** Ab (minor third) — a half note, lingering  
  - **Bar 3, beat 3:** D (major seventh) — lifted, almost like a question  
  - **Bar 3, beat 4:** **Rest** — silence, space, tension

- **Approach:**  
  - No scale runs  
  - No vibrato on the first note — it’s a statement, not a cry  
  - The rest is deliberate — it’s the pause before the answer

---

### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) — Resolution**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **Bar 4, beat 1:** C (major third) — resolves the tension of the Ab  
  - **Bar 4, beat 2:** D (major seventh) — brings it back to the Fm7 sound  
  - **Bar 4, beat 3:** A (fifth) — grounding, solid  
  - **Bar 4, beat 4:** F (root) — long, resonant, with a slight vibrato  
  - **End on F**, sustaining just a hair past the bar line — like the breath before the story begins

---

### **Overall Feel:**  
- **Dante’s Motif:** A simple, haunting melody that carries the weight of a question  
- **Marcus’s Bass:** A solid, grounded line with chromatic seasoning  
- **Diane’s Piano:** A painter, coloring the air with emotion and harmonic surprise  
- **Little Ray’s Drums:** The heartbeat, always moving, always forward
