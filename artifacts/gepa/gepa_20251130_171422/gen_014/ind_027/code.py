**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Setup. Build tension. The room holds its breath.*

- **Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On beats 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
- **Fill:** A syncopated, open-ended ride cymbal on beat 4, fading into the silence.  
- **Feel:** Tight, but with a lingering *space* — like the first breath before a storm.

### **Bar 2: Full Band Enters (Marcus, Diane, You)**  
*The moment. The question. The challenge.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Dm7 → F#m7  
*Phrase: D - F# - G - A*  
*Play it with a soft, smoky tone — like a memory you're not sure you remember.*  
*Let the note on A hang — don’t resolve it yet.*

**Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line in D minor, starting on C (chromatic approach to D), moving to F#, G, A, Bb, B, C, D...*  
*Each note a step deeper into the room.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp on 2 and 4 with Dm7 and F#m7 chords.*  
*Left hand: walking bass line (playing *with* Marcus, not against him).*  
*Right hand: sparse, angular, with a touch of dissonance — like a whisper.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Continues the pattern, but adds a subtle brush stroke on beat 3 — a push, not a hit.*

---

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax) — The Return**  
*You come back. The motif. The answer is not what he expected.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Dm7 → F#m7 → Gm7  
*Phrase: D - Bb - C - D*  
*This time, the note on D is a full, resonant tone — the answer that *feels* like a question.*

**Marcus (Bass):**  
*Continuing the walking line, now with a slight rubato feel — the rhythm is steady, but it’s *moving* now.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp on 2 and 4 again, but with a slight shift in voicings — the mood deepens, the tension climbs.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Adds a rimshot on beat 2 — a sharp pop, like a door opening.*

---

### **Bar 4: The Secret is Shared**  
*The resolution. The moment. The memory walks through the door.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Dm7 → Bm7  
*Phrase: D - C - B - A*  
*End on A — a half-step below D. It's unresolved, but it's *fulfilled*.*  
*A whisper at the end, like a breath you didn’t know you were holding.*

**Marcus (Bass):**  
*Final note: C (walking line ends on C, just below D — the pivot point).*

**Diane (Piano):**  
*Final comp: Bm7 — a dissonant, open chord that doesn’t resolve but *invites* resolution.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Final beat: A roll on the snare, fading into silence. The room holds its breath again.*

---

**Ending:**  
Silence.  
But not empty.  
It's full.  
It’s the kind of silence that says,  
*“I was here.”*

**Wayne Shorter leans forward.**  
He nods.  
He knows.  
He’s heard it before — but not like this.
