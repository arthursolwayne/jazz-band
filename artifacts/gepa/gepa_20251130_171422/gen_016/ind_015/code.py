**Title: "Unspoken"**  
**Key: Dm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  
**Mood: Restless curiosity, unresolved tension, a question in the air.**

### **Bar 1 - Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit Setup:**  
- Kick on **1 and 3** (subtle, punchy, not overbearing)  
- Snare on **2 and 4** (crisp, with a slight backbeat)  
- Hi-hat on **every eighth** (light, open, with a little space between 2 and 3)  
- **Fill:** On beat 4, a half-time snare hit with a ghost note on the "and" of 4, suggesting anticipation.

**Purpose:** Build tension, not rhythm. The groove is there, but it's waiting. The silence between the hits is as important as the hits themselves.

### **Bars 2–4 – Full Ensemble**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Bar 2:** Dm7 → A7♭9 → Dm7  
  - Line: D → C → B♭ → A (chromatic approach to A)  
- **Bar 3:** Gm7 → C7♭9 → Gm7  
  - Line: G → F → E♭ → D (chromatic approach to D)  
- **Bar 4:** Dm7 → A7♭9 → Dm7 (repeat of bar 2, but with a slight variation in rhythm)  
  - Line: D → C → B♭ → A (same as bar 2, but with a slight delay on the last note)

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comping on 2 and 4** —  
  - **Bar 2:** Dm7 (C, E♭, G, B♭)  
  - **Bar 3:** Gm7 (F, A, C, D)  
  - **Bar 4:** Dm7 again (same as bar 2)  
- **Chord voicings:**  
  - Dm7: C (rootless), E♭, G, B♭  
  - A7♭9: C, E♭, G, A  
  - Gm7: F, A, C, D  
- **Left hand:** Walking bass in the background, but subtle. Right hand is always coloring, never crowding.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Bar 2:** Same pattern as bar 1, but slightly more aggressive on the snare on beat 2.  
- **Bar 3:** Fill on the "and" of 2 with a rim shot, then a short roll into the snare on beat 3.  
- **Bar 4:** Same as bar 1, but with a slightly wider space on the "and" of 4 — leaving the room to breathe.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:**  
  - **Bar 2 (beat 1):** E♭ (long, breathy, with a slight grace note on D)  
  - **Bar 2 (beat 2):** D (staccato, punchy)  
  - **Bar 2 (beat 3):** C (legato, sliding into it)  
  - **Bar 2 (beat 4):** B♭ (sustained, unresolved, hanging there)  
- **Bar 3:** Silence. No sound. Just the breath.  
- **Bar 4:**  
  - **Beat 1:** E♭ again, but this time a little higher in register, like a question.  
  - **Beat 2:** D  
  - **Beat 3:** C  
  - **Beat 4:** B♭  
  - **End:** No closure. Just a breath held — the kind that makes you lean forward.

### **Final Thought:**

This is a question — not a statement. It's the sound of a door opening, not closing. Wayne Shorter will hear it, and if he leans forward, it's because he’s heard something he hasn’t heard before. It’s not a quote. It’s not a nod. It’s something that wants to be answered — and it’s waiting for you to do it.
