### **Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s): Little Ray (Drums)**

- **Kick:** On 1 & 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 & 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every 8th note  
- **Fill:** Subtle ride cymbal accent on beat 3, just before the entrance  
- **Feel:** Tense, but poised — like the moment before a door creaks open

---

### **Bars 2-4 (1.5 - 6.0s): Full Quartet**

#### **Diane (Piano):**  
**Chords (Comping on 2 & 4):**  
- **Bar 2:** F7 (F A C E)  
- **Bar 3:** Bb7 (Bb D F A)  
- **Bar 4:** Eb7 (Eb G Bb D)  
- **Voicings:** Rich, slightly extended (9ths or 13ths where space allows)  
- **Approach:** Chromatic bass lines on the off-beats, creating tension before the resolution  
- **Left hand:** Walking line, chromatic passing tones, never repeating the same note twice  

---

#### **Marcus (Bass):**  
**Walking line:**  
- **Bar 2:** F – G – Ab – A (chord tones and chromatic passing)  
- **Bar 3:** Bb – C – Db – D  
- **Bar 4:** Eb – F – F# – G  
- **Feel:** Tight, locked in with the drums, but with a subtle push on the off-beats to give the melody room  

---

#### **Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick:** 1 & 3  
- **Snare:** 2 & 4  
- **Hi-hat:** Every 8th  
- **Ride cymbal:** Subtle, on the "and" of 1 and 3, just under the surface  
- **Fill:** After the first note of your melody, a quick rim shot on the “&” of 4 to frame the resolution  

---

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif (Simple, haunting, with space):**

- **Bar 2:**  
  - F (long, singing tone)  
  - A (half-note, slight push on the second half)  

  *Let the note hang. Let the silence speak. Let the room breathe.*

- **Bar 3:**  
  - D (staccato, played behind the beat, like a whisper)  
  - C (half-note, resolving just before the snare on beat 4)  

  *This is the question. This is the memory. This is the door.*

- **Bar 4:**  
  - F (full note, resonant, with a slight bend at the end)  
  - (Leave the final note suspended slightly before the snare hits, creating a moment of release)

  *And then, the room leans in.*

---

### **Final Notes:**

- You end the phrase just before the snare on beat 4.  
- Diane holds the Eb7 chord, letting it ring out.  
- Marcus walks into the next chord, but doesn’t resolve immediately — he waits.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward. He’s heard it. He’s listening.

**That's the intro.**  
**That's the doorway.**  
**That's what he's been waiting for.**
