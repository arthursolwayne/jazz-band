**Title: "The Whisper Before the Storm"**

**Key:** D minor  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM (4/4 time)  
**Length:** 4 bars (6 seconds)  

---

### **Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5 seconds)**  
**Little Ray on Drums:**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hihat on every eighth  
- *But:* On beat 3, he plays a ghost note on the snare (just a light hit, not the full one).  
- On beat 4, he holds the hihat open for a half-beat before closing it with a sharp "chick."  
- *Effect:* The pulse feels steady but slightly off-kilter, like a heartbeat you’re not sure is yours.

---

### **Bar 2 (1.5 - 3.0 seconds)**  
**Marcus on Bass (D2-G2, MIDI 38-43):**  
- D2 (root), F (diminished 3rd), G2 (fifth), Bb (chromatic approach up from A to Bb)  
- Then: C (chromatic approach down to B), B (leading tone), A (tonic of G)  
- *Effect:* Roots and fifths with chromatic movement — grounded but unsettling.

**Diane on Piano:**  
- Bar 2: Dm7 (D-F-A-C) — open voicing, high C  
- Bar 3: G7 (G-B-D-F) — minor 9th voicing (G-B-D-F-A)  
- Bar 4: Cm7 (C-Eb-G-Bb) — open voicing, high Bb  
- *Comping:* On 2 and 4.  
- *Effect:* Each chord is a mood, not a function. She doesn't resolve — she invites.

### **Bar 3 (3.0 - 4.5 seconds)**  
**You on Tenor Sax (D minor):**  
- Play a short, fragmented motif:  
  - **Bar 3, beat 1:** D (melodic minor)  
  - **Bar 3, beat 2:** F# (chromatic upper neighbor)  
  - **Bar 3, beat 3:** E (half-step down, unresolved)  
  - **Bar 3, beat 4:** Rest  
- *Effect:* A question. A voice searching. A story that hasn’t found its beginning.

---

### **Bar 4 (4.5 - 6.0 seconds)**  
**You on Tenor Sax (D minor):**  
- Repeat the same motif, but start it on beat 1 and end on beat 3:  
  - **Beat 1:** D  
  - **Beat 2:** F#  
  - **Beat 3:** E  
  - **Beat 4:** Rest  
- *Effect:* The same phrase, but now it feels like a memory — something you almost remember, but not quite.

**Marcus on Bass:**  
- Resolves to D2 (root), but with a sharp, dissonant G# in the upper register  
- *Effect:* A whisper of resolution, but still unresolved.

**Diane on Piano:**  
- Bar 4: Dm7 (D-F-A-C) — same as bar 2, but with a trill on the high C  
- *Effect:* A haunting echo.

**Little Ray on Drums:**  
- On beat 4, he plays a cymbal crash — not loud, not dramatic, just a sound that makes the room feel bigger  
- *Effect:* The intro ends not with a finish, but with a breath.

### **Final Effect:**  
A question in the first bar, a mood in the second, a memory in the third, and a whisper in the fourth. No resolution, no answer. Just a feeling — like something just walked in the door, and you're not sure if you're ready for it.
