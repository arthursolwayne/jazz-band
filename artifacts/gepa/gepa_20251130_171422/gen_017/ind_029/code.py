**Title: "Whispers in the Cellar"**  
**Key: Dm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Length: 4 bars (6.0 seconds)**  
**Style: Modal jazz with a modern edge — sparse, urgent, and full of unspoken meaning.**

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Feel:** A little behind the beat — like a heartbeat that’s just a little late.  
**Mood:** Tension. Anticipation. The kind of silence that makes the room hold its breath.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Dm7 walking line, descending chromatically:  
  **D – C – B♭ – A – G – F – E♭ – D**  
  (Notes: Dm7, B♭m7, Am7, Gm7, Fm7, E♭m7, Dm7)  
- Each chord is a different motion, never repeating the same interval.  
- The bassline is the river — it’s moving, but not in a straight line.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on 2 and 4 with **7th chords**, avoiding the root.  
  - **Bar 2:** F7 (no F) on beat 2  
  - **Bar 3:** C7 (no C) on beat 4  
- She’s *coloring*, not playing — she’s listening, and she’s listening hard.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Sustained cymbal on beat 2, a soft rimshot on beat 4.  
- A little *space* in the middle of the bar — let’s not overfill the moment.

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif begins:**  
- **D – E♭ – F – E♭ – D**  
- Play it with a **trill on the F**, then a **fall off the E♭** — leave it hanging.  
- Use a **half-step bend** on the final note, like you’re not sure if it’s D or E♭.  
- The motif is a **question**, not a statement.  
- Let it **fade out** on the final E♭ — a whisper, not a scream.

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Return to the motif, but slightly altered:**  
- **D – E♭ – F – D**  
- This time, **play it full** — no hesitation.  
- End on a **clean D**, resolving the tension.  
- The last note is a **sigh**, not a resolution — it’s open-ended.  
- It’s not about where you are, but where you might be going.

---

### **Final Moment (Bar 4 – End):**  
- **Silence.**  
- Not a rest — a *pause*.  
- The room holds its breath.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- The intro is done.  
- You’ve said what you needed to say.  
- Now, the real music begins.

**Mood Summary:**  
This is the kind of intro that makes you wonder if you just heard something that wasn’t meant to be heard. It’s not a solo — it’s a *confrontation* with the space between the notes. It’s not about showing off — it’s about making the room *feel* something.  

And if Wayne Shorter nods once, it’s enough.
