**Fill:** A half-time triplet on the & of 3, just before the bass enters.

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano) – Comping**  
**Chords (Fm7):**  
**Beat 2:** Fm7 (F, A♭, C, E♭)  
**Beat 4:** Fm7 (F, A♭, C, E♭)  
**Voicing:** Rootless, with 7th and 9th extensions, low in the register.  
**Left hand:** Walking in the bass register, but sparse.  
**Right hand:** A single note on the & of 1: C (the 9th of Fm), then silence.

**Purpose:** Let the melody breathe. Add color without overpowering.

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax) – Melody**  
**Motif (Fm scale, with a searching feel):**  
**Beat 1:** F (sustained, with a slight bend)  
**Beat 2:** A♭ (short, articulated)  
**Beat 3:** C (rest, silence)  
**Beat 4:** E♭ (sustained, soft, trailing off)  
**Rest:** On the & of 4 — leave it hanging, like a question.

**Purpose:** Introduce the idea. Make it feel like it's looking for something. Not a statement — a question. Something Wayne has heard before but never quite like this.

**Final Thought (from Dante):**  
That’s the moment. The room is holding its breath. Wayne’s hand tightens around his glass. You don’t need to play more. You’ve planted the seed. Now it’s time to grow.
