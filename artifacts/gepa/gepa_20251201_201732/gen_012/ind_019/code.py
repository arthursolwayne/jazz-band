**"Breath Before the Fall" — 4-Bar Intro in Dm, 160 BPM**

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**
- **Kick:** On beat 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On beat 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note, playing **half-time** (i.e., on 1&2&3&4&)  
- **Fill:** On the **& of 3**, a short **brushed roll** that fades into silence, like a breath inhaled.

> **Effect:** A heartbeat starts, then stops — the audience holds their breath.

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**
- **Chord:** Cm7♭5 (C-E♭-G♭-B♭)  
- **Voicing:** Open, with left hand on **C** (MIDI 60) and **B♭** (MIDI 70), right hand on **E♭** (MIDI 64) and **G♭** (MIDI 67)  
- **Comp:** On beats 2 and 4  
- **Rhythm:** **Staccato, with a slight delay on beat 4** — gives it a floating, unresolved feeling

> **Effect:** A strange, dissonant chord that lingers like a question.

### **Bar 3: Marcus (Bass)**
- **Line:** D2 – F2 – D2 – F2 – **C#2** (chromatic approach to D)  
- **Rhythm:** Quarter notes on 1, 2, 3, and 4 — but the **C#2** is **grace** (light, barely there)  
- **Roots and fifths, with a chromatic approach**  
> **Effect:** The anchor, but slightly off — like he knows something’s about to change.

### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax)**
- **Motif:**  
  - **Bar 4, beat 1:** **D** (MIDI 62), quarter note  
  - **Bar 4, beat 2:** **F** (MIDI 65), eighth note  
  - **Bar 4, beat 3:** **Rest**  
  - **Bar 4, beat 4:** **D** (MIDI 62), eighth note, **lingering** on the **beat**  
- **Attack:** Clean, breathy, with a **slight vibrato** on the final D  
- **Silence after the note:** A full second, just the sound of the room  
> **Effect:** A short phrase that doesn’t finish — it *invites* the rest of the song. Leaves something hanging. Makes you lean in.

### **Total Duration:** 6.0 seconds  
### **Key:** Dm  
### **Feeling:** Suspense. A question. A memory just outside the light.  
### **Purpose:** To make Wayne Shorter *feel* something. Not just hear it.

You don’t need to play more. You just need to *mean* it.
