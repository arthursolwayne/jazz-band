    *“What if I remembered?”*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Fills:  
  - On 2 & 4  
  - Light ride cymbal on 2 & 4

### **Final Moment:**  
- The last note of your sax — a soft D, slightly bent — hangs in the air.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
- The room is silent.  
- You’ve just made your mark.

**That’s it.**  
You’re not trying to impress him.  
You’re trying to be heard.  
And for the first time, you are.
