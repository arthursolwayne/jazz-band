### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1, 3

**Voicings:** Open, spread, with space between notes

**Motif (second half):**  
**Bar 3, beat 2:** A♭  
**Bar 3, beat 3:** C  
**Bar 3, beat 4:** D (a half-step above the F from bar 2 — a return, but changed)

**Chord on beat 2:** D♭m7 (D♭, F, A♭, C)

**Motif (completion):**  
**Bar 4, beat 2:** D  
**Bar 4, beat 3:** F  
**Bar 4, beat 4:** A♭ (a half-step above the previous D — it’s almost a resolution, but it’s not)  
**End on A♭ — a whisper of Fm, but with the suggestion of something else**

---

### **Final Silence (Bar 4, beat 4, after last note):**  
**Everyone holds note for a half-beat, then silence falls — leaving the room holding its breath**  
**Wayne Shorter leans forward.**

**End of Intro.**  
**The story begins in the silence after the last note.**
