### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-Hat:** On every eighth note  
**Feel:** A tight, driving groove with a slight edge — like a heartbeat with a pulse of tension. The hi-hat is sharp, the snare cuts through, but it’s all under control. The room breathes, and the anticipation builds.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- **Beat 1:** F# (chromatic approach to G)  
- **Beat 2:** G  
- **Beat 3:** A (chromatic approach to Bb)  
- **Beat 4:** Bb  
**Phrasing:** Smooth, walking, but with a slight rub against the beat — like a man who’s seen too much. The bass line is the heartbeat of the story, steady but with a memory in every note.

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Chords:**  
- **Beat 2:** G7 (G B D F)  
- **Beat 4:** C7 (C E G Bb)  
**Comping:** Crisp, with a sharp edge. The G7 is a question, the C7 is a door. She plays with fire, but it’s controlled. The chords are a map, and she’s leading you somewhere.

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- **Beat 1:** Bb (chromatic approach to B)  
- **Beat 2:** B  
- **Beat 3:** C# (chromatic approach to D)  
- **Beat 4:** D  
**Phrasing:** The line is building now. It’s not just walking — it’s *telling*. Every note is a step into the unknown.

---

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Chords:**  
- **Beat 2:** D7 (D F# A C)  
- **Beat 4:** F7 (F A C Eb)  
**Comping:** The D7 is a turning point. The F7 is the edge of a cliff. She’s not just playing chords — she’s painting the air with tension.

---

### **Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- **Beat 1:** D (chromatic approach to Eb)  
- **Beat 2:** Eb  
- **Beat 3:** F# (chromatic approach to G)  
- **Beat 4:** G  
**Phrasing:** The line is now resolving, but not fully. It’s a question with no answer yet. It’s the moment before the jump.

---

### **Bar 4 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Chords:**  
- **Beat 2:** G7 (G B D F)  
- **Beat 4:** C7 (C E G Bb)  
**Comping:** The G7 is the last question, the C7 is the door that’s still closed. She’s holding back, letting the room feel the weight of it.

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Melody (Motif):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (open, strong, like the first breath)  
- **Beat 2:** G (a step forward, but uncertain)  
- **Beat 3:** A (the high point, the question)  
- **Beat 4:** Rest (the silence, the space)  

**Phrasing:** You play it slow, like you’re telling a story you’ve never told before. The note on A is the peak — it’s not a high note, it’s a moment. Then, you leave it hanging. The room holds its breath. Wayne leans forward.

### **END OF INTRO**

It's not a solo. It's a beginning.  
It's not a scale run. It's a memory.  
It's not a show. It's a story — and the room is listening.

Wayne Shorter nods.  
He knows.
