**Key:** Fm (F minor)  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM (4/4 time)  
**Duration:** 6 seconds (4 bars)  
**Mood:** Searching, urgent, mysterious — like the first breath of a story about to begin.

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every 8th note  
**Fill:** A subtle brush stroke on the snare at the end of the bar, like the faint sound of wind — not too loud, just enough to make the room hold its breath.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Starts with a walking line in Fm, but with chromatic tension.  
**Example:**  
F – G♭ – G – A♭ – B♭ – B – C – D♭  
Then repeats with slight variation. The line is smooth but unstable, like water just before it breaks.

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comping on 2 and 4 with sharp, driving 7th chords.  
**Example (Bar 2):**  
On beat 2: E♭7 (E♭ G B♭ D)  
On beat 4: D♭7 (D♭ F A♭ C)  
She plays with fire, but she’s not louder — she’s just *more*.

---

### **Bar 2 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
Start your motif.  
**Phrase:**  
F – G♭ – A♭ – B♭  
Play it with a slight delay on the G♭, as if you’re not sure where you are.  
Let the note hang. Don’t resolve it. It’s the question.

**Technique:**  
*Legato* with a touch of *vibrato* on the B♭. A little breathy, like you’re whispering the beginning of a secret.

---

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Continues his walking line, but now with a slight upward motion.  
**Example:**  
C – D♭ – D – E♭ – F – G – G♯ – A  
It’s still chromatic, but it’s moving forward — like a river finding its way.

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4 again, but now she plays with a bit of *rubato* on the 2nd beat, like she’s trying to catch up with the melody.  
**Example (Bar 3):**  
Beat 2: C7 (C E G B)  
Beat 4: B♭7 (B♭ D F A)  
She’s not fighting you — she’s *listening*.

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Phrase:**  
B♭ – C – D♭ – E♭  
This is the answer to the question you asked in bar 2.  
But don’t resolve it. Let the last note — E♭ — be open.  
Leave it hanging. Make the room wait.

**Technique:**  
*Staccato* on the C, then *legato* on the D♭ and E♭. A slight *fall* in tone on the E♭ — like it’s slipping through your fingers.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Now he’s climbing. His line is still chromatic, but it’s moving toward resolution.  
**Example:**  
A – B♭ – B – C – D♭ – D – E♭ – F  
It’s a slow build — not a resolution, but a *promise* of one.

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comp on 2 and 4, but this time she adds a *passing chord* on beat 3.  
**Example (Bar 4):**  
Beat 2: D♭7  
Beat 3: Cmaj7  
Beat 4: B♭7  
She’s pushing the harmony forward — not to end it, but to *inspire* it.

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Phrase:**  
E♭ – F – G♭ – A♭  
This is the *last* note of your motif.  
You don’t play it. You *suggest* it.  
You hold the note on the A♭ for a fraction of a second, then let it fall away like a shadow.  
You leave the room with a question — not an answer.

**Technique:**  
*Very soft*, almost inaudible. A single breath, a whisper in the dark.

---

**Final Effect:**  
The room is silent for a beat. The rhythm section keeps moving — the bass like a river, the piano like a storm, the drums like a heartbeat.  
You stand there, sax in hand, waiting.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
Something is about to happen.
