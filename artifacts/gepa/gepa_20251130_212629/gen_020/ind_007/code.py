**Title: "The Question"**  
**Key: D minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds**

### **Bar 1 (0:00–1:50)**  
**Little Ray on drums** —  
- Kick on **beat 1**, snare on **beat 3**  
- Hihat on **every eighth note**, starting on **beat 1**  
- **Fill on beat 2**: A quick, syncopated triple stroke on the snare, timed so it lands just after the downbeat — a subtle push, like a breath held before the fall.  
- **Beat 4**: Hihat cut short, almost like a gasp.  

> *The room holds its breath. A question is about to be asked.*

### **Bar 2 (1:50–3:40)**  
**Enter Diane on piano** —  
- **Beat 2**: Left hand plays a **Dm7** chord (D, F, A, C)  
- **Beat 4**: She plays a **B♭7** chord (B♭, D, F, A) — a **chromatic passing chord**, a half-step away from the root  
- **Comp pattern**: She plays **on the 2 and 4** as instructed, but her left hand plays a **chromatic descending line** in the bass:  
  - **Beat 2**: A  
  - **Beat 3**: G  
  - **Beat 4**: F  
- Right hand: A **tritone substitution** on beat 4 — a **G7** chord (G, B, D, F), resolving *just* short of the expected Dm7.  

> *A shadow of a resolution, but something is missing. She plays the tension, not the release.*

### **Bar 3 (3:40–5:30)**  
**Marcus on bass** —  
- **Beat 1**: A **chromatic approach** to D:  
  - **Beat 1**: C♯  
  - **Beat 2**: D  
- **Beat 2**: A **chromatic line** in the bass:  
  - D → C → B → A (all on the beat, but just barely, almost in the space between the drum hits)  
- **Beat 3**: Another **chromatic line**:  
  - A → G → F → E  
- **Beat 4**: A **rest** — silence on the downbeat  
- This is the anchor, but it’s **shifting**, **questioning**, **never settling**.  

> *The rhythm is off-center. It’s like a step back, but not a resolution. It’s a hesitation.*

### **Bar 4 (5:30–6:00)**  
**Dante on tenor sax** —  
- **Beat 1**: A **short, angular phrase**:  
  - **D (beat 1)** → **F (beat 2)** → **E (beat 3)** → **rest on beat 4**  
- **Phrase**:  
  - D **(beat 1)** — a clear, present note  
  - F **(beat 2)** — a minor third up, a question  
  - E **(beat 3)** — a half-step down, a return, but not to the root  
  - **Beat 4**: **Rest** — the silence hangs  
- The rest is **not empty**. It’s **full of possibility**. It’s **the moment before the answer**.  

> *The air is thick with unspoken things. Wayne Shorter leans forward. He knows this sound. He’s heard it once before — in a dream, or in a memory he hasn’t quite placed yet.*

---

### **Final Note**:  
You don’t finish the thought. You let it live in the space. You leave the answer out there — a question that lingers in the air, echoing off the concrete walls of The Cellar like a ghost of a song that was never quite written.

> *That’s the kind of intro that gets you noticed.*
