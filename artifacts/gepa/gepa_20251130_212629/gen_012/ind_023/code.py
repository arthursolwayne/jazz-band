### **Bar 1: Little Ray on Drums**  
**Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On beats 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Fill:** On the & of 4 — a short, open-ended roll that fades into silence.  
*The room holds its breath.*

### **Bar 2: Marcus on Bass**  
**Line:**  
- **Beat 1:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)  
- **Beat 2:** Gb (chromatic approach to G)  
- **Beat 3:** G (staccato, slightly behind the beat)  
- **Beat 4:** Ab (chromatic descent, with a slight rub against Diane’s comp)  
*The anchor begins to move, but not in a way that gives away the melody.*

---

### **Bar 3: Diane on Piano**  
**Comp:**  
- **Beat 2:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
- **Beat 4:** F7 (same chord, slightly altered with a Gb in the right hand)  
*She plays with a heat that feels like resistance — like she’s not just supporting, but pushing back.*

### **Bar 4: Dante on Tenor Sax**  
**Melody:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (long, slow breath, like the first note of a story)  
- **Beat 2:** Ab (half note, sustained, with a slight upward inflection)  
- **Beat 3:** D (rest — the sound lingers in the air)  
- **Beat 4:** F (back to F, but with a subtle vibrato that suggests return, not resolution)  
*You don’t finish the phrase. You leave it hanging. You invite the storm in.*

**Final Note:**  
Wayne Shorter leans forward. The room holds its breath. The intro is done.  
But the music — it’s just beginning.
