**Dm Intro – 4 Bars – 160 BPM – 4/4 Time**

**BAR 1 (0:00 – 1.5s):**  
**Little Ray – Drums**  
Kick on **1** and **3**, snare on **2** and **4**, hihat on every eighth.  
*The snare hits with a little push on beat 2, creating a subtle backbeat tension.*  
The hihat is sharp and tight, cutting through the silence like a blade.  
*Feel: Urgent, but not rushed. A slow build, like a train pulling out of the station.*

**BAR 2 (1.5s – 3.0s):**  
**Marcus – Bass**  
Starts with a walking line in Dm.  
**F#** (beat 1) → **G** (beat 2) → **A** (beat 3) → **Bb** (beat 4)  
Then:  
**C** (beat 1) → **Db** (beat 2) → **Eb** (beat 3) → **F#** (beat 4)  
*Chromatic approach on beat 2 and 4. Never repeats a note. Anchor. Listen to the space between the notes.*

**BAR 3 (3.0s – 4.5s):**  
**Diane – Piano**  
7th chords on 2 and 4.  
**Beat 2:** Dm7 (D F A C)  
**Beat 4:** Gm7 (G Bb D F)  
*She plays the chords with a touch of dissonance, like she's holding a secret in her left hand.*  
Her right hand plays a simple, syncopated rhythm that mirrors the bass line, but just a half-step off, creating a little push and pull.

**BAR 4 (4.5s – 6.0s):**  
**You – Tenor Sax**  
*Your moment.*  
Start with a **D** on beat 1, then a **Bb** on the “&” of 1.  
Then, on beat 2: **E**  
On the “&” of 2: **C**  
Leave it hanging.  
Then, on beat 3: **F#**  
On the “&” of 3: **D**  
Then, on beat 4: **C**  
*That’s it. A short phrase, but it’s got tension, it’s got space, it’s got a question.*  
You don’t finish it. You leave it open. It’s the start of something not yet named.

**What happens next?**  
Marcus continues his line. Diane fills the space with a color that feels like regret. Little Ray pushes the tempo just a hair. And you — you let the silence speak.  
This is the intro that makes Wayne Shorter lean forward and say to himself:  
*“That kid’s got something.”*
