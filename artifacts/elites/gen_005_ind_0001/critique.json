  "rationale": "The arrangement lacks essential jazz harmony elements, relying on basic triads (C-E-G, D-F-A) without 7th extensions or functional progressions. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat hits only on the 'and's in a very limited pattern. The saxophone line has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. There is no interplay between instruments as the trumpet is silent throughout, and the piano plays static triads without comping. The overall feel is academic and lacks the improvisational spirit of jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz sophistication",
    "Add chromatic approach notes to the saxophone line for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in the hihat pattern with more syncopation",
    "Use walking bass (roots, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) instead of just root notes",
    "Add ii-V-I progressions in bars 3-4 for authentic jazz harmony"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
