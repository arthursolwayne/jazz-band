**Title: "The First Question"**  
**Key: F major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Length: 4 bars (6 seconds)**  
**Mood: Suspenseful, intimate, searching**

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- **Kick**: On beats 1 and 3 — subtle, taut, with a slight delay on beat 3 to create tension.  
- **Snare**: On beats 2 and 4 — crisp, with a slight economy of motion.  
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth note, but at half-volume, barely there. Just enough to feel the rhythm, not to hear it.  
- **Fill**: A single open hi-hat on the "and" of 3, like a breath before something happens.

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano) – Comping**  
- **Chord**: Fmaj7 (F-A-C-E) – open voicing, right hand plays the 7th (E) on beat 2, left hand plays F and C on beat 4.  
- **Rhythm**: On beats 2 and 4.  
- **Feel**: A gentle, yearning resolve. The chord is warm but unresolved in the emotional sense — like a question.

### **Bar 3: Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line**  
- **Notes**:  
  - Beat 1: **F (D2)**  
  - Beat 2: **C (D3)**  
  - Beat 3: **Bb (D3)** – chromatic approach to C  
  - Beat 4: **C (D3)**  
- **Rhythm**: Even eighth notes, with a slight pull on the 3rd beat to emphasize the tension.

### **Bar 4: Dante (Tenor Sax) – Melody**  
- **Phrase**:  
  - **Beat 1**: F (low register, with a slight breath before sound)  
  - **Beat 2**: A (same register, a half-step above F — dissonant, but intentional)  
  - **Beat 3**: Bb (chromatic descent, a whisper of resolution)  
  - **Beat 4**: C (resolve, but not fully — leave it hanging, a question mark in the air)  
- **Phrasing**: Each note is a pause, a breath, a thought. No vibrato at first, just a clean, clear tone. The motif is simple, but it *means* something — it's a voice, not a run.

### **Final Moment**  
At the end of bar 4, a beat of silence — not from the band, but from the room. Wayne Shorter sits up. The air is thick with possibility.

**That's the intro.**  
It’s not about showing off. It’s about asking the question that needs to be asked. That’s the thing that matters.
