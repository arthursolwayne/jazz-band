---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit Setup:**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth  
- **Fill:** On the last eighth of bar 1, a soft, ghosted snare on beat 4, just before the band enters.  
- **Feel:** Tense, expectant, like the moment before a storm.

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Roots:** D, F, G, B♭ (Dm7 voicing)  
- **Walking line:** D – F – G – B♭ – C – D♭ – C – B♭ (chromatic descent into B♭)  
- **Rests:** No rest. Always moving, always searching.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp:** Dm7 (D F A C) on beat 2  
- **Voicing:** Dm7(♭9) on beat 4 (D F A C E♭)  
- **Rests:** No rest. She’s listening, she’s feeling it, but she’s not playing *over* you — she’s playing *with* you.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick:** 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &  
- **Snare:** 2 & 4  
- **Hi-hat:** Every eighth  
- **Fill:** On beat 3, a soft rim shot and ghosted toms. It’s subtle, but it *feels* like a breath held.

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif:**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **Beat 1:** D (sustained, low, rich)  
  - **Beat 2:** F (up a major third, with a slight bend)  
  - **Beat 3:** G (half note, leaning back)  
  - **Beat 4:** Rest (long, deliberate, breath held)  

**Notes:**  
- You don’t play the whole phrase. You play the first three notes, leave the last one hanging — like a question, like a memory.  
- **Tone:** Warm, but with a hint of grit — like a soulful cry in the dark.  
- **Dynamics:** Start soft, build just enough to be felt, then fall away.

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax) (Continued)**  
**Motif (continued):**  
- **Beat 1:** B♭ (resolve, but not fully)  
- **Beat 2:** D (return, but higher, more urgent)  
- **Beat 3:** F (rest again, this time shorter, more urgent)  
- **Beat 4:** G (hold it, linger, let it *mean* something)  

**Notes:**  
- This is the resolution — not a conclusion, but a setup.  
- It’s not about showing off. It’s about *saying something* — something that lingers.  
- Wayne leans in. He’s heard it. He knows.

### **Final Moment (After Bar 4):**  
Silence.  
The room holds its breath.  
Wayne Shorter nods once.  
You know he heard it.

**That’s your intro.**  
You don’t need to explain it.  
You just need to *make it feel like the beginning of something* — something real.
