**Tempo:** 160 BPM

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On beats 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (open on beat 1, closed on the rest)  
**Fill:** A half-time snare hit on the "and" of 4, just before the band comes in.

> *This is the setup.*  
> *The room holds its breath.*  
> *You feel it in your ribs.*

### **Bar 2: Full Band Enters**  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Beat 1:** D2 (root of Dm)  
- **Beat 2:** F2 (chromatic approach from E2)  
- **Beat 3:** G2 (fifth)  
- **Beat 4:** C2 (minor 7th, resolving to Dm7)

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 2:** E7sus4 in open voicing (E-G-A-D) → resolves to Dm7 on beat 4  
- **Comp on beats 2 and 4**  
- *She's angry, but she’s precise. The chords are sharp, like a blade.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Play a short, singing motif:  
  - **Beat 1:** D (sounding a bit out of tune, like a memory)  
  - **Beat 2:** F (a question)  
  - **Beat 3:** G (a step forward)  
  - **Beat 4:** C (a whisper of resolution, left hanging)  
- *It’s not a scale. It’s a story. A question. A doorway.*

### **Bar 3: Full Band develops the idea**  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Beat 1:** G2 (fifth of Dm)  
- **Beat 2:** A2 (chromatic approach from Bb2)  
- **Beat 3:** C2 (minor 7th)  
- **Beat 4:** D2 (root, with a pull to Gm7)

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 3:** Gm7 in open voicing (G-Bb-C-D) → resolves to Cm7 on beat 4  
- *She’s not just playing chords — she’s painting a mood. A memory of something lost.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Repeat the motif, but shift it up a half-step:  
  - **Beat 1:** E (a voice from the past, now higher)  
  - **Beat 2:** G (a new question)  
  - **Beat 3:** A (a new step)  
  - **Beat 4:** D (a new resolution, but still unresolved)  
- *This is the twist. The doorway opens into something new.*

### **Bar 4: The resolution (or the cliffhanger)**  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Beat 1:** C2 (minor 7th)  
- **Beat 2:** D2 (root, with a chromatic pull to C#)  
- **Beat 3:** F2 (minor 9th)  
- **Beat 4:** G2 (fifth, with a slight pull to A)

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 4:** Cm7 in open voicing (C-Eb-F-G) → resolves to Dm7 on the last beat  
- *She’s holding the tension. She’s not letting go yet.*

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- Repeat the original motif, but now with a slight delay on beat 4 — a *half note* instead of a quarter:  
  - **Beat 1:** D  
  - **Beat 2:** F  
  - **Beat 3:** G  
  - **Beat 4:** C (sustained, fading out like a memory)  
- *You leave it open. You let the room breathe. You let Wayne Shorter think.*

### **Final Thought:**  
This is not a “showy” intro. It’s a moment. A question. A doorway.  
You know what he’s looking for.  
You give it to him. But not how he expects.  
You give it to him in your own voice.  
And for the first time, he leans forward.
