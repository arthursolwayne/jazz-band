**Title: "Question in the Dark"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  
**Mood: Searching. Restless. Hopeful.**

---

### **Bar 1 (0.0 – 1.5 seconds): Little Ray – Drums Only**

- **Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On beats 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note, slightly behind the beat  
- **Fill:** A ghost note on the "and" of 4, just before the rest of the band enters  
- **Feel:** Tight, but with a slight hesitation — like the first breath before a jump

---

### **Bar 2 (1.5 – 3.0 seconds): Full Band Enters**

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **Bass note (F):** On beat 1  
  - **First note (G):** On beat 2, short and sharp  
  - **Rest:** On beat 3  
  - **Second note (Bb):** On beat 4, held with a slight vibrato  
  - **Rest:** On the "and" of 4  
  - *Motif:* F – G – (rest) – Bb – (rest)  
  - *Phrase length:* 4 beats, but only 2 notes — the rest is silence, the space between the notes is the voice

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp:**  
  - **Bar 2:** F7 (F, A, C, E) on beat 2 and 4  
  - **Grace note:** A on beat 1, resolving to F on beat 2  
  - **Voice leading:** Chromatic approach to the G in the sax line  
  - *Chords:* F7, then A7 on beat 4 (dominant to dominant, tension)

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Walking line:**  
  - F – G – Ab – A – Bb – B – C – D – Eb – F (chromatic approach to Bb, ends on F)  
  - *Bass line:* A walking line that circles back to F, with a chromatic approach on the Bb just before the sax plays it  
  - *Rhythm:* 16th notes, steady, never repeating the same note twice

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** Every eighth, slightly behind  
- **Fill:** A quick 8th note ghost on the "and" of 4  
- *Feel:* Still tight, but now with energy pushing forward

---

### **Bar 3 (3.0 – 4.5 seconds): You Continue the Motif, Diane and Marcus Support**

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **Note 1 (F):** On beat 1, same as before  
  - **Note 2 (Bb):** On beat 2, same note as in bar 2  
  - **Rest:** On beat 3  
  - **Note 3 (Ab):** On beat 4, new note, descending from Bb  
  - *Motif now:* F – Bb – (rest) – Ab – (rest)  
  - *Change:* The melody is now moving, descending, and the space is still there

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp:**  
  - **Bar 3:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab) on beat 2 and 4  
  - **Voice leading:** Smooth transition from F7 to Bb7  
  - *Chords:* Bb7, with a chromatic approach from A to Bb on beat 2

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Walking line:**  
  - Ab – A – Bb – B – C – D – Eb – F – G – Ab (chromatic approach to Ab, ends on Ab)  
  - *Rhythm:* 16th notes, still walking, still never repeating the same note

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** Every eighth, slightly behind  
- *Feel:* Energy rising, a bit more aggressive on the kick, but still controlled

---

### **Bar 4 (4.5 – 6.0 seconds): Resolution – or Not?**

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **Note 1 (F):** On beat 1  
  - **Note 2 (G):** On beat 2  
  - **Note 3 (Bb):** On beat 3  
  - **Note 4 (F):** On beat 4  
  - *Motif now:* F – G – Bb – F  
  - *Not a resolution, but a return — the question asked in bar 1 is answered with a breath of F, but it’s not a full resolution. It’s a pause. A question that’s still open.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp:**  
  - **Bar 4:** F7 (F, A, C, E) on beat 2 and 4  
  - **Voice leading:** Smooth return to F7, but with a small chromatic twist on the E  
  - *Chords:* F7, ending on the V chord, unresolved

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Walking line:**  
  - F – G – A – Bb – C – D – Eb – F – G – A (chromatic approach to A, ends on A)  
  - *Rhythm:* 16th notes, walking steady, still no repeats

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** Every eighth, slightly behind  
- *Feel:* Full energy, but the last note of the sax is held, and the drummer hesitates on the snare on beat 4 — a tiny space before the rest of the band comes in.

### **Final Note:**

This intro is not a statement — it’s a question. It’s the whisper before the shout, the silence before the scream. It's designed to make Wayne Shorter lean forward, not because it's familiar, but because it’s *searching* — for something real, something true.

And that’s what jazz is. Not answers, but questions.
