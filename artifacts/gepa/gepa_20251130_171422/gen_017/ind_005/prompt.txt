Create a compelling, emotionally charged opening that hints at a deeper story — not just rhythm, but tension, space, and a melody that lingers. Use dynamic variation, rhythmic contrast, and avoid predictable patterns. Make the first bar feel like a question, and the next three like the search for an answer. Let the silence speak, and let the music breathe. Avoid even rhythms and uniform dynamics — let the energy shift and the mood evolve. Give the listener something to lean into, not just follow.
