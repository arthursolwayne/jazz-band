**INTRO – 4 BARS IN D MAJOR (160 BPM)**

---

**BAR 1 – LITTLE RAY (DRUMS)**  
*Space, tension, anticipation.*

- Kick on **beat 1** (low, deep, crisp).
- Snare on **beat 3** (dry, punchy, slightly behind the beat).
- Hi-hat on **every eighth note** (light, open, a bit off the grid).
- **Beat 2 and 4** are empty — silence is the instrument here.
- The room holds its breath, waits.

---

**BAR 2 – FULL BAND ENTRANCE**

**MARCUS (BASS) – D2-G2 (MIDI 38-43)**  
- Root on beat 1 (D2), chromatic approach (C#2) on "and" of 2.
- Fifth (A2) on beat 3, chromatic approach (Bb2) on "and" of 4.
- Subtle dynamic swell — soft to loud — to push the energy forward.

**DIANE (PIANO)**  
- **Bar 2:** Open voicing: **D7 (D, F#, A, C#)** — rooted, but with tension.
- **Bar 3:** Shift to **Bm7 (B, D, F#, A)** — a pivot, a question.
- **Bar 4:** Resolve to **Gmaj7 (G, B, D, F#)** — clear, open, but not predictable.
- She plays with dissonance and release — anger in the spaces between notes.

**LITTLE RAY (DRUMS)**  
- Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.
- A little syncopation on the "and" of 3 and 4, but not too much — let the rhythm breathe.

**BAR 3 – YOU (TENOR SAX)**  
*The melody begins — a short, emotional motif.*

- **Beat 1:** D (D4), full, resonant, with a slight delay.
- **Beat 2:** B (B4), held — a long note, a question.
- **Beat 3:** A (A4), soft, almost whispered.
- **Beat 4:** Rest. Silence. Let it hang.

*The room is quiet now. You’re holding it.*

---

**BAR 4 – YOU (TENOR SAX)**  
*The resolution — the return.*

- **Beat 1:** D (D4), same as before, but with a different tone — more soul.
- **Beat 2:** F# (F#4), a step up, a slight cry.
- **Beat 3:** G (G4), a gentle release.
- **Beat 4:** C# (C#4), a whisper, a question, a portal.

*You leave it unfinished. The room is alive. Wayne Shorter leans forward.*

**END OF INTRO – 6 SECONDS, ONE QUESTION, ONE MOMENT.**  
*The rest of the song will answer it.*
