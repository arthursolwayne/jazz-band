  "rationale": "The arrangement uses basic triads in the piano and bass (C, D, G, Am, F) without 7th extensions or jazz harmony vocabulary. The rhythm section has a repetitive pattern with minimal syncopation, lacking the authentic Latin jazz feel. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop phrasing or blues inflection. There is no interplay between instruments, and the trumpet remains silent throughout. The overall feel is generic and lacks the sophistication and spontaneity of jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) to add jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes and bebop phrasing to the saxophone lines",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in the hihat pattern for authentic jazz feel",
    "Implement walking bass lines with roots, 3rds, 5ths, and 7ths",
    "Add call-and-response between saxophone and trumpet for better interplay"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize the use of jazz-specific harmonic vocabulary (7th chords, extensions), demand swing feel in the rhythm section, and require interplay between instruments. Include examples of bebop phrasing and call-and-response patterns."
