**Key: Dm7 (D minor 7)**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Time: 6 seconds**  
**Bars: 1–4**  
**Mood: Tense, searching, whispering — a question left in the air.**

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**

**Rhythm:**  
Kick on 1 and 3  
Snare on 2 and 4  
Hi-hat on every eighth  
**Fill:**  
On beat 4, a ghost note on the snare, just before the bass enters.  
**Feel:**  
Tight, controlled, but with a dark edge. A heartbeat in the dark.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**

**Line (walking in Dm):**  
**D – Eb – F – G**  
**Bb – B – C – D**  
**Chromatic approach on F (E to F), then a half-step resolution to G.**  
**Dynamics:**  
Start soft, building slightly. The anchor, but not the center of attention.  
**Feel:**  
Subtle, deep, like a low tide pulling you back.

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**

**Comp:**  
**2nd beat:** Bbm7 (Bb – D – F – Ab)  
**4th beat:** Cm7 (C – Eb – G – Bb)  
**Voicings:**  
Chords are open, but slightly dissonant — like a memory not quite recalled.  
**Dynamics:**  
Soft, with a slight rubato feel on the 2nd beat.  
**Feel:**  
Cool, but with heat underneath — anger in the quiet.

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**

**Motif (melody):**  
**Bar 3 – Measure 1–2 (1st beat):**  
**D – Eb (half note, soft, whispered)**  
**Bar 3 – Measure 3–4 (2nd beat):**  
**F – G (half note, slightly louder, building)**  
**Rest on beat 3.**  
**Rest on beat 4.**  

**Dynamics:**  
Start with a breathy, breathless sound — like the first word of a confession.  
**Feel:**  
A question, not an answer. A cry that stops mid-sentence.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble:**

**Marcus:**  
**D – Eb – F – G** (same as in bar 2, but slightly louder)  
**Diane:**  
**2nd beat:** Dm7 (D – F – A – C)  
**4th beat:** G7 (G – B – D – F)  
**Little Ray:**  
**Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.**  
**You:**  
**Bar 4 – Measure 1–2 (1st beat):**  
**D – Eb (half note, same as bar 3, now with full weight)**  
**Bar 4 – Measure 3–4 (2nd beat):**  
**F – G (half note, now with strength, but still not a resolution)**  
**Rest on beat 3 and 4.**  

**Dynamics:**  
End on a breath — not a resolution, but a pause.  
**Feel:**  
Completion that isn’t. A moment that hangs in the air, waiting for the next note.

---

**Final Note (from you):**  
You hold the rest — not a silence, but a space.  
The kind of space that Wayne Shorter might recognize.  
The kind that says, *I’m not here to play for you. I’m here to ask a question.*  

And that, my friend, is the kind of opening that stays with you.
