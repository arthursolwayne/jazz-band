You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Here's the thing: Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait. Use a driving rhythm that builds tension with precise, energetic execution. Let the silence in the other instruments speak.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before. Your motif should be brief, singable, and emotionally resonant — not a technical display, but a moment that lingers.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- Marcus: Walking line (D2-G2, MIDI 38-43), roots and fifths with chromatic approaches, not scales. He's the anchor. His lines should feel like a heartbeat — steady, grounded, with a sense of direction.
- Diane: Open voicings, different chord each bar, resolve on the last. Comp on 2 and 4. Her chords should add color and tension, not just harmony. Let the emotions in her playing show through.
- Little Ray: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar. His rhythm should be tight, precise, but not overbearing. He is the engine, but he must stay in the background until the moment is ready.
- You: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit. Your line should feel like a question, not an answer — something that invites the rest of the band to respond.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.

Generate a complete Python script using `pretty_midi` that captures the essence of this moment — a melody that feels like the first breath of a new idea, supported by a rhythm section that holds the space and a pianist who adds tension and depth. Make Wayne lean forward.
