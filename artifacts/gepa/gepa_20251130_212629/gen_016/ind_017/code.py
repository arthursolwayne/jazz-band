**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on every eighth, but with a *light* touch — like a whisper on a cold morning.  
*Fills:* One subtle ghost note on the 3rd beat, a half-time hihat on the 4th. The tension is building, but it’s restrained.  
*Feeling:* Like a door opening, but not all the way.

**Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters (Bar 2):**  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
Starts with a walking line in F, but with a twist — chromatic approach to the 3rd (G).  
**Line:**  
F – Gb – G – A – Bb – B – C – Db – C – B – A – G – F  
(Slight chromatic descent at the end, resolving back to F, but with a questioning edge.)

**Diane (Piano):**  
7th chords, comping on 2 and 4. A **B7** on beat 2, then a **E7** on beat 4.  
*Left hand:* Walking bass line, but with hammer-ons and pull-offs, slightly ahead of the beat.  
*Right hand:* Chordal texture, but with a dissonant, almost *daring* sound — like she’s daring the audience to listen closer.

**Little Ray:**  
*Drums stay consistent*, but now *slightly louder* — like a heartbeat.  
*Hihat on every eighth*, but with a subtle *swell* on the 4th beat.

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Start with a short motif, but leave it hanging.*  
**Phrase:**  
F (on beat 1) – rest (beat 2) – G (beat 3) – rest (beat 4)  
*It's a question, not a statement.*  
*Play it with a breathy, almost spoken tone — like you're about to say something important and you’re holding back.*

---

**Bar 4 – Full Ensemble (Resolution of the Question):**  

**Marcus:**  
Continues walking, but this time, the chromatic approach is on the **5th** (C) — moving up to D, then back to C.  
**Line:**  
F – G – A – Bb – C – D – C – Bb – A – G – F  
*A slight rubato at the end.*

**Diane:**  
Same 7th chords, but now with a **D7** on beat 2, and a **G7** on beat 4.  
*She adds a dissonant tritone in the right hand on beat 3 — a G# against the C in the left hand. It’s a controlled chaos.*

**Little Ray:**  
*Same pattern*, but now *the hihat swells harder on the 4th beat* — like a release, like a breath after a long silence.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
*You come back in on beat 3 with the same motif, but this time you finish it.*  
**Phrase:**  
F – rest – G – F  
*Spoken, not sung. A whisper into the void. The question is asked, but the answer is still in the air.*
