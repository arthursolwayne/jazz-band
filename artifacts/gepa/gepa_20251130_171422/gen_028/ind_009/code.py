**Title: "Whispers Before the Storm"**  
**Key: D minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick drum on 1 and 3**  
**Snare on 2 and 4**  
**Hi-hat on every eighth note**

- **Feel:** Taut, precise, building tension. The hihat creates a relentless pulse, like the ticking of a clock. The kick and snare are sharp, but not aggressive — they’re the heartbeat of the storm waiting to break.

---

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
**Walking line, chromatic approach to Dm7**  
**Notes:**  
- **Beat 1:** C# (chromatic approach to D)  
- **Beat 2:** D  
- **Beat 3:** F (from Dm7)  
- **Beat 4:** G (from Dm7)  
- **Beat 1 (next bar):** A (chromatic approach to Bb)  
- **Beat 2:** Bb  
- **Beat 3:** D  
- **Beat 4:** F

**Feel:** Anchored, but with a sense of movement forward. The chromatic notes add unresolved tension, like the air before a lightning strike.

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
**Comp on 2 and 4, Dm7 and G7**  
- **Beat 2:** Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
- **Beat 4:** G7 (G, B, D, F)  
- **Left hand:** Walking octaves, descending from A to G  
- **Right hand:** Voicings that hint at chromaticism but stay in D minor

**Feel:** She’s not pushing — she’s listening. Each chord is a question, not an answer. The B in the G7 is a roadmap, but not a destination.

---

### **Bar 3 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Same pattern, but with a slight swell in dynamics on beat 3.**  
**Hi-hat slightly louder, kick more present.**

**Feel:** The energy is rising — the storm is getting closer. The tension is palpable.

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
**Same walking line, but with a slight emphasis on beat 3.**

**Feel:** The bass is now pushing forward, like the wind before the rain.

---

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
**Same comp, but with a trill on the D in the Dm7.**  
**Left hand now ascends from G to A.**

**Feel:** The piano is restless. It wants to go somewhere, but it can’t — not yet.

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif: D – F – G – C# (half-step up to F, then to G, then to C#, which resolves back to D)**

**Phrasing:**
- **Beat 1:** D (soft, almost a whisper)  
- **Beat 2:** F (a slight lift, a question)  
- **Beat 3:** G (a bit of tension, like the edge of a blade)  
- **Beat 4:** C# (a dissonant, unresolved note — the storm isn’t here yet, but it’s coming)

**Feel:** You’re not showing off. You’re giving him something — a melody that’s simple, but sharp. It’s not a scale run. It’s a story in four notes. It’s the moment before the storm.

---

### **Final Moment:**

- The room holds its breath.
- Wayne Shorter leans forward.
- The saxophone says something he hasn’t heard before.
- The storm is coming — and you’re the first to feel it.

**End of 4 bars.**  
**The audience is waiting.**  
**You’ve made your point.**  
**Now — it’s time to storm.**
