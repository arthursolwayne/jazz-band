You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

You're playing with your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- **Drums (Little Ray):** Use subtle dynamics — not just loud or soft, but with shading and texture. Create rhythmic interest by varying the placement of the kick, snare, and hihat. Use rests and space to build tension. Avoid monotony — let the rhythm breathe.
- **Bass (Marcus):** Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He's the anchor, but make him sing. Let his line be active and melodic, not just functional.
- **Piano (Diane):** Comp with 7th chords, on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving. Let the emotion come through — it’s not just rhythm, it’s feeling.
- **Sax (You):** This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit. Make it concise, memorable, and emotionally resonant.

**Goal:** Make Wayne Shorter lean forward. Create a moment that feels intentional, alive, and unique — like a door just opened.
