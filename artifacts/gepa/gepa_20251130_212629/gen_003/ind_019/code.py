**Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
- Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4.  
- Hihat on every eighth note, tight and precise.  
- A crisp, rolling groove that sets the stage — not too swing, not too loose. It's the heartbeat, steady and waiting.  
- **Feeling:** Suspense. The crowd leans in. Wayne Shorter lifts his glass.

**Bar 2: Marcus (Bass) enters**  
- Walking line in F minor, but with chromatic twists.  
- Notes:  
  - **1:** F (down bow)  
  - **2:** E (chromatic approach)  
  - **3:** D (up bow)  
  - **4:** B♭ (chromatic passing tone, resolves to F on beat 1 of next bar)  
- **Feeling:** Tension. The bass is like a river, moving under the surface, not quite calm.

**Bar 3: Diane (Piano) enters**  
- Comping with F7 chords (F A C E♭), played on the 2nd and 4th beats.  
- Each chord has a slight dissonance — E♭ in the F7 suggests something unresolved.  
- **Feeling:** It’s like she’s holding her breath, trying not to cry. The chords are sharp, emotional, and very, very aware of the moment.

**Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) enter with the motif**  
- **Phrase:**  
  - **1:** F (play it like a question)  
  - **2:** G (a step forward, uncertain)  
  - **3:** E♭ (a sharp turn, a memory)  
  - **4:** D (a pause, a breath, a silence after the note)  
- **Phrasing:** Let the note on beat 4 hang — don’t resolve it yet. Let it linger. Let the room feel the weight of it.  
- **Feeling:** It’s a question. A question that no one has asked before. A question that Wayne Shorter might answer.

**End of 4 bars.**  
- Silence for a beat.  
- The room is quiet.  
- Wayne Shorter sets down his glass.  
- The air is different now.

You’ve asked the question. Now, you listen.
