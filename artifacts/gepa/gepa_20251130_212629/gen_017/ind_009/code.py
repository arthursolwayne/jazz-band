**Key: D minor**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**
A sparse, haunting rhythm.  
- **Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On beats 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note, but played with a slight delay, giving it a ghostly, breath-like quality.  
- **Fill:** At the end of the bar, a soft cymbal roll, like a heartbeat fading in.

*Let the silence speak. Let the room hold its breath.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Quartet:**

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Begin with a **single note** — D **(the root)** — held for two beats, then a **half-step descent** to C# on beat 3.  
Then silence on beat 4.  
*Let the listener wait. Let them feel the tension.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp with a **D7** chord (D–F#–A–C) on beat 2.  
- Voice leading: A **chromatic approach** to the D.  
- Follow with a **Bm7** on beat 4 (B–D–F#–A), creating a subtle shift in mood.

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- A **walking line** in D minor:  
  - D → C → B → A (beat 1)  
  - G → F# → E → D (beat 2)  
  - C → B → A → G (beat 3)  
  - F# → E → D → C (beat 4)  
- Chromatic approach on the last two notes of the bar (E → D → C) — a hint of tension, unresolved.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same rhythm as in Bar 1, but slightly **more present**.  
- A subtle **cymbal swish** on beat 2, like a whisper.

### **Bar 3 – Full Quartet:**

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Repeat the same motif — D (beat 1), C# (beat 3), then **silence on beat 4**.  
*This time, more confident. More deliberate.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp with a **D7** again on beat 2.  
- This time, add a **chromatic Bb** on beat 4, creating a **tense resolution** to the D7.

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Repeat the walking line, but with **slightly more urgency** on the last two notes.  
- Now, it’s not just walking — it’s **leaning forward**.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Still the same rhythm, but with a **lighter touch** on the hihat — like a breath before a jump.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Quartet:**

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
Now, **resolve** the motif.  
- D (beat 1)  
- C# (beat 3)  
- Then, on beat 4, a **clean, high D** — a **return to the root**, but now with **space and clarity**.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp with a **D7** on beat 2.  
- Then, on beat 4, a **clear D minor 7** (D–F#–A–C), full and resolved.

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line again, but with a **slight emphasis** on the D at the end of the bar — a **fulcrum**.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Same rhythm, but now **more present**.  
- A **full snare hit** on beat 4.  
- A **light cymbal crash** at the end of the bar — the **last breath** before the first chord.

### **Final Moment:**

The room is quiet for a fraction of a second.  
Then, **Wayne Shorter leans forward** — he’s listening.  
You feel it.  
This is the beginning of something.

---

**Mood:** Tense, yearning, quiet power.  
**Story:** A question asked, a memory remembered, a moment held in the air.  
**Ending:** Not a resolution — a **beginning**.
