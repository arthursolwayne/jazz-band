**Title: "Whispers in the Dark"**  
**Key: Fm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Length: 4 bars (6 seconds)**  
**Mood: Searching, yearning, intentional**

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3 (snare on 2 and 4)  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Fill:** A subtle, open-ended brush stroke on the snare at the end of the bar — just a whisper.

**Purpose:** Build tension, create space, make the audience lean in.

---

### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**  
**Chord:** B♭m7♭5 (B♭ D♭ F A♭)  
**Voicing:** Open, spread out (B♭ in the left hand, A♭ in the right hand)  
**Comping:** Strum on the "and" of 2 and the "and" of 4. Let the chord hang, don’t rush it.

**Purpose:** A question in the air. The first moment of color, not resolution.

---

### **Bar 3: Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- **Beat 1:** D2 (Fm root)  
- **Beat 2:** C2 (chromatic approach above the root)  
- **Beat 3:** D2 again  
- **Beat 4:** C2 (rest)  

**Purpose:** A walking line that hints at the Fm but never quite lands. A ghost in the bass.

### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax) – The Melody**  
**Motif:**  
- **Beat 1:** Fm (F) — a long, sustained note, bending slightly down  
- **Beat 2:** A♭ (from the B♭m7♭5 chord) — a short, sharp, upward glissando  
- **Beat 3:** Rest  
- **Beat 4:** F — back to the root, but with a slight delay and a breath of silence before it resolves

**Phrasing:** The first note is the question. The second is the answer, but it doesn’t feel complete. The silence says the rest.

---

### **End of Bar 4:**  
- **Little Ray:** A soft, brushed snare roll on the last eighth of the bar  
- **Marcus:** A very light pluck of the open E string (Fm fifth)  
- **Diane:** A quick, sharp, single note on the F (root of the key)  
- **You:** The final F — held, not played, just the intention of it.

**Total time:** 6.0 seconds  
**Impact:** A question. A memory. A whisper in the dark. Wayne Shorter leans forward.
