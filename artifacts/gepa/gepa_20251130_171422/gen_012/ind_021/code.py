**Title: "Breath Before the Leap"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**

---

**[Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)]**  
*Space is everything here.*  
- Kick on **beat 1** (strong, deep).  
- Snare on **beat 3** (a whisper, like a heartbeat).  
- Hihat on **every eighth note**, but soft, almost muted.  
- No cymbals, just the rhythm.  
- **Ends on a rest** — the room holds its breath.

**[Bar 2 – Full Band Enters]**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walks in with a chromatic line starting on **F**, descending:  
  **F – Eb – D – C** (beat 1)  
  **Bb – A – G – F** (beat 2)  
  **Ab – G – F – Eb** (beat 3)  
  **D – C – Bb – A** (beat 4)  
- Never repeats a note, always moving with tension and release.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Plays **F7** on beat 2 (F, A, C, Eb).  
- Then **Bb7** on beat 4 (Bb, D, F, Ab).  
- Subtle, but full of emotion — like a thought she’s trying to say.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on **1 & 3**, snare on **2 & 4**, hihat on **every eighth**.  
- Fills the bar with life, but still listens.  
- The rhythm is there, but the space is still sacred.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- Starts with a short, simple motif:  
  **F – G – Eb – D** (beat 1–2)  
  **C – Bb – A – G** (beat 3–4)  
- It’s not a run, it’s a story — whispered, like a secret.  
- Ends on a **sustained G**, leaving the note hanging in the air.  
- No resolution — just a question.

**[Bar 3 – Full Band Enters (Same as Bar 2)]**

**Marcus:**  
- Same walking line, slightly altered to echo the beginning.  
- Adds a **chromatic passing tone** on beat 3 (C to Bb).  
- Smooth, but with intention.

**Diane:**  
- Same chords, but now she adds a **left-hand melodic line** that mirrors Dante’s motif.  
- Subtle, but it’s there — a shared language.

**Little Ray:**  
- Same rhythm, but now with a **crash cymbal on beat 4**, just a whisper.  
- It’s not loud, but it’s **there**, like a heartbeat.

**Dante:**  
- Begins to **answer** the question from bar 2.  
- Plays the same motif, but **transposed up a third** (to **A – B – G – F**).  
- It’s the same, but **new** — like a memory that just walked in.

**[Bar 4 – Full Band Enters (Same as Bar 2)]**

**Marcus:**  
- Same line, but now with **a subtle rubato** on the last note (A).  
- It’s the anchor, but it’s **moving**.

**Diane:**  
- Same chords, but now with a **melodic line that resolves into Bb**.  
- It’s not the answer, but it’s **close**.

**Little Ray:**  
- Same rhythm, but now with a **light brush on the snare at the end**, like a sigh.

**Dante:**  
- Takes the motif one last time, **completes it**, but ends on a **sustained Bb**.  
- Not a resolution — just a **pause before the next question**.  
- A breath held before the leap.
