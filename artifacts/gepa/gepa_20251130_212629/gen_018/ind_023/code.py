---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Start with space. A single kick on beat 1, then a snare on beat 2, with hihat on every eighth. The hihat is tight, but not too aggressive. It’s like the heartbeat before the storm.*

- **Kick:** 1  
- **Snare:** 2  
- **Hi-hat:** 8th notes on 1 & 2 & 3 & 4  
- **Cymbal fill:** On the “& of 4” – a soft crash, lingering just a beat.

---

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
*Start walking. Chromatic line, descending from G♭ to E♭. The line is smooth, deliberate, and grooves under the tension.*

- **Notes:**  
  - **Beat 1:** G♭  
  - **& of 1:** F  
  - **Beat 2:** E♭  
  - **& of 2:** D♭  
  - **Beat 3:** C  
  - **& of 3:** B♭  
  - **Beat 4:** A♭  
  - **& of 4:** G♭ (resolve slightly, but not completely)

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
*Comping on 2 and 4 with F7 chords. She’s not too loud, just enough to color the space. Her left hand plays a simple walking line, using the same chromatic descent as the bass. Right hand: F7 (F, A♭, C, E♭).*

- **Left Hand:**  
  - **Beat 2:** E♭  
  - **Beat 4:** D♭  
- **Right Hand:**  
  - **Beat 2:** F7 (F, A♭, C, E♭)  
  - **Beat 4:** F7 again, with a slight tritone substitution on the “& of 3” (B♭7) to add tension.

---

### **Bar 3 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Now, the energy rises. Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. A light fill on the “& of 4” — a ride cymbal roll, building anticipation.*

- **Kick:** 1, 3  
- **Snare:** 2, 4  
- **Hi-hat:** 8th notes  
- **Ride cymbal:** 3 short hits on the “& of 4”

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass)**  
*Continuation of the chromatic line. Walks down from G♭ to F again, then resolves to E♭ on the last beat. He’s setting up the space for the melody.*

- **Notes:**  
  - **Beat 1:** G♭  
  - **& of 1:** F  
  - **Beat 2:** E♭  
  - **& of 2:** D♭  
  - **Beat 3:** C  
  - **& of 3:** B♭  
  - **Beat 4:** A♭  
  - **& of 4:** G♭

---

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano)**  
*Same as before, but with a slight shift in the comp. She adds a B♭7 on the “& of 3” to heighten the tension. Her left hand continues the walking line, matching Marcus.*

- **Left Hand (walking):**  
  - **Beat 1:** G♭  
  - **Beat 2:** E♭  
  - **Beat 3:** C  
  - **Beat 4:** A♭  
- **Right Hand:**  
  - **Beat 2:** F7  
  - **Beat 4:** F7  
  - **& of 3:** B♭7 (tritone substitution)

---

### **Bar 4 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
*Full kit now. Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on every eighth. A slight roll on the “& of 4” — like a breath before the melody begins.*

- **Kick:** 1, 3  
- **Snare:** 2, 4  
- **Hi-hat:** 8th notes  
- **Ride cymbal:** 3 short hits on the “& of 4”

---

### **Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass)**  
*Now, a slight resolution. The line ends on F, the tonic. It’s not a full resolution — it’s just a breath, a suggestion.*

- **Notes:**  
  - **Beat 1:** G♭  
  - **& of 1:** F  
  - **Beat 2:** E♭  
  - **Beat 3:** D♭  
  - **Beat 4:** F (resolved on the downbeat)  
  - **& of 4:** E♭ (leaving it hanging)

---

### **Bar 4 – Diane (Piano)**  
*Comp on 2 and 4 with F7 again. She plays the same chord, but with a slight emphasis on the 13th (A) on the “& of 4” — a subtle hint that something is coming.*

- **Right Hand:**  
  - **Beat 2:** F7 (F, A♭, C, E♭)  
  - **Beat 4:** F7 with a slight A added on the “& of 4”  
- **Left Hand:**  
  - **Beat 1:** G♭  
  - **Beat 2:** E♭  
  - **Beat 3:** C  
  - **Beat 4:** F (resolved on the downbeat)

---

### **Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
*Your moment. One short, haunting motif. Start it, leave it hanging. Make it sing. Use the F minor scale, but with a twist — a half-step resolution that feels like a question.*

- **Notes:**  
  - **Beat 1:** F  
  - **& of 1:** E♭  
  - **Beat 2:** D♭  
  - **& of 2:** C  
  - **Beat 3:** B♭  
  - **& of 3:** A♭  
  - **Beat 4:** G♭  
  - **& of 4:** F (resolve just slightly, but not completely)

*Let the note ring out. Don’t resolve. Let it hang. That’s the question. That’s what Wayne Shorter leans forward for.*

**End.**  
*The room holds its breath. The intro is done. Now — the song. But the question is already there.*
