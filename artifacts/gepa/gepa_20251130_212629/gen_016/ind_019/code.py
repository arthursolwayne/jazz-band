**Dante Russo — Intro to “The Weight of the Moment”**  
**Key: Dm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4)**  
**Time: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  
**Mood: Urgent, emotional, haunted. The weight of a moment.**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Set the mood. Build tension. A slow, deliberate kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on every eighth, but not too loud — just enough to make the air feel tight. Syncopated fills at the end of the bar, building anticipation.*

**Patterns (approximate):**  
- Kick: 1 – – 3 – – – –  
- Snare: – 2 – 4 – – – –  
- Hihat: x x x x x x x x  
- Fill: [brushed snare roll, soft cymbal wash] at the end of the bar.

**Bar 2 – Enter the Quartet:**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line in Dm, chromatic approaches, never repeating a note. Starts on D, moves chromatically down to C, then up to D again. Phrasing is like a question, unresolved.*

**Line (in Dm):**  
D → C → D → Eb → F → G → Ab → G → F → E → D  
(Each note is a half-step, walking in a circle, never settling.)

**Diane (Piano):**  
*Comping on 2 and 4 with 7th chords. Dm7 on 2, Gm7 on 4. No rhythm, just harmony. Let the space breathe. The chords are dark — like a memory you can’t forget.*

**Chords (Bar 2):**  
- 2: Dm7  
- 4: Gm7  

**Diane’s Right Hand:**  
*No melody — just comping. She’s not trying to be heard, just to hold the space so Dante can speak.*

**Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
*Your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — this is about space and silence, emotion and weight.*

**Phrase (Tenor Sax – Dm):**  
- Bar 3:  
  - D (quarter note)  
  - Eb (eighth note)  
  - D (eighth note rest)  
  - C (quarter note)  

*Let it hang on that C. Let the silence speak. Let the room hold it. This is the moment. You don’t finish the phrase — you leave it open. Wayne Shorter is leaning forward.*

---

**Bar 4 – Full Ensemble:**  
*Marcus continues the walking line. Diane adds Fm7 on 2, Cm7 on 4. Little Ray builds to a peak with a snare roll and cymbal crash. The energy is rising, the tension is breaking.*

**Diane’s Chords (Bar 4):**  
- 2: Fm7  
- 4: Cm7  

**Little Ray:**  
- Kick: 1 – – 3 – – – –  
- Snare: – 2 – 4 – – – –  
- Hihat: x x x x x x x x  
- Fill: [snare roll at the end of the bar, cymbal crash]

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
*You repeat the motif, but now it’s answered. You land on D — the root of the key. The moment is complete. But it lingers.*

---

**End of Intro.**  
*The room holds its breath. Wayne Shorter nods. You’ve made him lean forward. You’ve made him want to hear the rest.*
