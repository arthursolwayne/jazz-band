You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Here's the thing: Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- **Drums (Little Ray):** Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Use dynamic variation and space to create tension. Don't repeat the same pattern or dynamics. Let the rhythm breathe. Use rests and subtle shading to build anticipation.
- **Bass (Marcus):** Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. Make it active and melodic. Avoid predictable intervals. Let the bass speak with emotion and shape the groove.
- **Piano (Diane):** 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of the way but keep it moving. Use emotion in every chord, not just rhythm. Avoid being too busy — let the space speak.
- **Sax (You):** This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit. Make it concise, memorable, and emotionally resonant.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.

Generate a complete Python script that builds the opening four bars of your piece using the `pretty_midi` library. Focus on:
- Subtle dynamics with variation — not just loud or soft, but with shading and texture.
- Rhythmic interest by varying the placement of the kick, snare, and hihat.
- Strategic use of rests and space to build tension and anticipation.
- A saxophone motif that is concise, memorable, and emotionally resonant.
- A bass line that is active and melodic, not just walking.
- A piano comp that supports and enhances the emotion, not just rhythm.

Avoid:
- Repeating the same rhythmic patterns or dynamics across the piece.
- Overusing the same pitches or intervals in the bass line.
- Making the piano too busy or cluttered — it must support and enhance the emotion.
- Filling every beat without breathing space, especially in the first bar.

Make Wayne lean forward.
