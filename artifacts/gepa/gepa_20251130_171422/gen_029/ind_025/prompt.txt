You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it’s 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Here’s the thing: Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He’s sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he’s watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn’t heard before.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- Marcus: Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He’s the anchor.
- Diane: 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving.
- Little Ray: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar.
- You: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.

Generate a complete Python script using the `pretty_midi` library.

Create a compelling, emotionally charged opening that hints at a deeper story — not just rhythm, but tension, space, and a melody that lingers. Use dynamic variation, rhythmic contrast, and avoid predictable patterns. Make the first bar feel like a question, and the next three like the search for an answer. The melody should be sparse but expressive, the rhythm should be urgent but not frantic, and the space between notes should say as much as the notes themselves.

Let the first bar be mysterious, the second bar build tension, the third bar offer a glimmer of resolution, and the fourth bar leave a lingering question. Use rests and dynamic shifts to shape the mood. Avoid monotony — every note and silence must feel purposeful.

Use dynamic variation in the drums, especially on the snare and hihat. The hi-hat should not be uniform — some notes slightly softer or louder to create texture. The kick and snare should be precise and impactful.

In the saxophone melody, use rests and space to create a sense of yearning. Don’t fill every beat — leave room for the silence to speak.

The bass should never repeat the same rhythm or note, and the piano should comp with tension — use 7th chords with occasional dissonance to add emotional weight.

Make the intro feel like a story beginning — something that lingers, something that makes Wayne lean forward.
