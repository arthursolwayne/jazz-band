**Title: "Echoes in the Cellar"**  
**Key: F minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM | 4/4 time**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Rhythm:**  
- Kick on beats 1 and 3  
- Snare on beats 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note  
- **But...** on beat 3, he plays only a light brush stroke on the snare — a hesitation, a pause.  
- **The beat is there**, but it feels like it’s holding back, like the silence before the storm.

> *Think of it as the moment before the door opens — you can feel the weight of something just outside the room.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line in F minor:  
  **F – Gb – Ab – A**,  
  then **Bb – B – C – Db**  
- Chromatic approach on the **Ab** (from Gb) and **Bb** (from A)  
- Each note is distinct, no repetition. He’s the anchor, but he’s got something to say.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Comp on **2 and 4**, using 7th chords:  
  - On beat 2: **F7** (F, A, C, Eb)  
  - On beat 4: **Ab7** (Ab, C, Eb, Gb)  
- She plays with tension, each chord a question, a challenge, a memory.  
- Her left hand plays a walking bass line, but her right hand is restless — wants to break free.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:**  
  - **Bb** (beat 1) – a low, growling note, like a whisper from the shadows  
  - **Ab** (beat 2) – a step down, a question  
  - **G** (beat 3) – a half-step resolution, like a sigh  
  - **F** (beat 4) – but it’s held open, unfinished, like a door left ajar  
- **No scale runs.** Just four notes, each with meaning, each with weight.  
- **Dynamics:** from a soft, smoky **pp** to a bold, resonant **mf** on the last note.

> *This is the moment Wayne Shorter leans forward. This is the question that lingers.*

---

### **Bar 3 – Momentum Builds**  
**Marcus:**  
- Continues walking line:  
  **Db – Eb – F – Gb**  
- Chromatic approach on **Db** (from C) and **Gb** (from F)  
- He’s subtle, but he’s building tension with every note.

**Diane:**  
- Comp on **2 and 4** again, but this time:  
  - Beat 2: **Bb7** (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
  - Beat 4: **Db7** (Db, F, Ab, Bb)  
- Her chords are getting darker, more urgent.  
- She plays a **chromatic line in the right hand** on the off-beats, a restless energy.

**Little Ray:**  
- Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
- **Fill on beat 3** with a quick **brush roll** on the snare — like a heartbeat increasing.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Repeat the motif**, but with **dynamic variation** and **a slight rhythmic shift**:  
  - **Bb** (beat 1) – same note, but a bit more space between it and the next  
  - **Ab** (beat 2) – same, but with a **delayed attack**  
  - **G** (beat 3) – slightly lower in volume, like a memory fading  
  - **F** (beat 4) – same as before, but now it feels like it’s being **answered**, slightly

> *It’s not the same as before — it’s like the question is being asked again, but with more weight.*

---

### **Bar 4 – The Moment**  
**Marcus:**  
- Walks into **Fm7** (F, Ab, Bb, Db)  
- Ends on **Db**, a half-step below the root — a **chromatic resolution** that doesn’t resolve.

**Diane:**  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4 again:  
  - Beat 2: **F7** (F, A, C, Eb)  
  - Beat 4: **Ab7** (Ab, C, Eb, Gb)  
- She’s building toward something, but it’s not resolution — it’s **tension with purpose**.

**Little Ray:**  
- Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4  
- **Cymbal crash on beat 3** — it’s the sound of a door slamming open.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Final statement of the motif**, but **with a slight rubato** on the last note:  
  - **Bb** (beat 1) – same as before  
  - **Ab** (beat 2) – same as before  
  - **G** (beat 3) – same as before  
  - **F** (beat 4) – now **sustained**, **swelling**, like something has finally been said out loud.

> *It’s not a resolution — it’s an invitation. The story is just beginning.*

---

### **Final Note:**  
You close on that **F**, held for a moment longer than the beat, and the room holds its breath.  
Wayne Shorter nods.  
The night is still young.  
But the story is already written in the air.
