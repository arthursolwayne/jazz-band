**Title: "The Question"**  
**Key: D Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick on 1 & 3**  
**Snare on 2 & 4**  
**Hi-hat: eighth notes on every beat, with a slight swell on 3 and 4, then a brief rest at the end of the bar.**

- *Feel:* A whisper of urgency, like the door creaking open. Not too loud, but it’s there. The heartbeat of the intro.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
- **D (root)** → **F# (chromatic approach)** → **G (tonic)**  
- **D (root)** → **C# (chromatic approach)** → **D (tonic)**  
- **Walking line:**  
  **D – F# – G – D – C# – D – F# – G**  
- *Rhythm:* Even eighth notes, with a slight emphasis on the downbeats and a subtle push on the upbeats.

#### **Diane (Piano)**  
- **Left Hand:** Walking bass line (same as Marcus, but slightly behind with a soft, staccato tone).  
- **Right Hand:**  
  - **Bar 2:** D7 (D–F#–A–C#) on beat 2  
  - **Bar 3:** G7 (G–B–D–F#) on beat 2  
  - **Bar 4:** D7 (D–F#–A–C#) on beat 2 and 4  
- *Comping style:* Subtle, sparse, with a touch of tension (C# on D7), but not overpowering.

#### **Little Ray (Drums)**  
- **Kick on 1 & 3**  
- **Snare on 2 & 4**  
- **Hi-hat:** eighth notes, with a slight swell on the last eighth of the bar  
- *Dynamics:* A little louder than Bar 1, but still restrained.

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
- **Motif:**  
  - **Bar 2 (beat 1):** D (quarter note)  
  - **Bar 2 (beat 2):** F# (eighth note)  
  - **Bar 2 (beat 3):** G (eighth note)  
  - **Bar 2 (beat 4):** Rest  
  - **Bar 3 (beat 1):** D (eighth note)  
  - **Bar 3 (beat 2):** C# (eighth note)  
  - **Bar 3 (beat 3):** D (quarter note)  
  - **Bar 4 (beat 1):** G (quarter note)  
  - **Bar 4 (beat 2):** B (eighth note)  
  - **Bar 4 (beat 3):** A (eighth note)  
  - **Bar 4 (beat 4):** Rest  

- *Phrasing:* The motif is a question — a single phrase that starts strong, dips, and ends with a wide space. It’s not a statement, it’s a question. It asks: *What comes next?*

### **Final Notes (Bar 4):**  
- The saxophone ends on a **rest**, leaving the room to breathe.  
- The piano and bass continue their comping, and the drums fill the space with a soft cymbal wash.  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward — he’s listening. He’s heard something he hasn’t heard in a long time.

**The moment is not in the notes, but in the space between them.**  
It’s a question — and the answer is still coming.
