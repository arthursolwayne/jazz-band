---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** 1, 3  
**Snare:** 2, 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Feel:** Tight, urgent, but not rushed. The tension is in the space between the hits.

### **Bar 2: Everyone in — Diane (Piano), Marcus (Bass), Dante (Tenor)**

**Diane (Piano):**  
- 2nd beat: Fm7 (F, Ab, C, D)  
- 4th beat: Bbm7 (Bb, Db, F, G)  
**Comp:** Soft, open, with space between chords. Let the silence speak.

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Walking line in F minor:  
  - 1: F → Gb (chromatic approach)  
  - 2: Ab → Bb (chromatic approach)  
  - 3: Bb → A (chromatic approach)  
  - 4: C → C (resolve on the downbeat of bar 3)  
**Feel:** Subtle, steady, with a slight rub against the beat.

---

### **Bar 3: Dante (Tenor Saxophone)**  
**Melody (Motif):**  
- F (1) → Gb (2) → Ab (3) → Bb (4)  
- Play the first three notes: F, Gb, Ab  
- Let it hang on the 4th beat.  
**Phrasing:** Smooth, legato, with a slight bend on the Ab.  
**Feel:** It’s a question — not yet answered. A memory knocking on the door.

---

### **Bar 4: Dante (Tenor Saxophone) — Finale**  
**Melody (Continuation):**  
- Bb (1) → C (2) → D (3) → Eb (4)  
- Resolve the phrase with a slight run up to Eb, then a breathless rest on beat 4.  
**Phrasing:** Let the last note linger. It's not a resolution—it's a setup.  
**Feel:** You’ve opened the door. Wayne leans forward.

### **Final Note:**  
The first four bars are a story in themselves. A memory that’s not quite here yet, but close. Wayne Shorter’s eyes narrow. He’s listening.
