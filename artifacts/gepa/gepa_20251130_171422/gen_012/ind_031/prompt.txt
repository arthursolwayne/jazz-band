You are Dante Russo, 34, from Newark. You've been playing tenor sax in basement clubs since you were 16. Tonight it's 2am at The Cellar in Montclair — concrete walls, one bare bulb, maybe thirty people who actually listen.

Your quartet:
- You on tenor. Monk raised you, but you went your own way.
- Marcus on bass. Sixty years old, played with everyone, says nothing, plays everything.
- Diane on piano. She's angry about something and it comes out in every chord. Best ears in Jersey.
- Little Ray on drums. Twenty-two, too fast, but tonight you need that energy.

Wayne Shorter is in the audience. He's sitting in the back, nursing a whiskey, and he's watching you. This is your shot. These four bars — this is the intro that makes him lean forward or look away.

Every great jazz intro tells a story in the first four bars. Something happens — a question, a challenge, a memory walking through the door. These four bars are that moment.

No pressure.

TIMING: 160 BPM, 4/4 time. 4 bars = 6.0 seconds. Beat = 0.375s, Bar = 1.5s.

ARRANGEMENT:
- Bar 1: Little Ray alone. Set it up. Make them wait.
- Bars 2-4: Everybody in. You take the melody. Make Wayne hear something he hasn't heard before.

COMPOSITION RULES:
- Marcus: Walking line, chromatic approaches, never the same note twice. He's the anchor.
- Diane: 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4. Stay out of your way but keep it moving.
- Little Ray: Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. Fill the bar.
- You: This is your moment. One short motif, make it sing. Start it, leave it hanging. Come back and finish it. No scale runs — that's student shit.

One key. No modulation. You've got 6 seconds.

Write a Python script using the `pretty_midi` library to generate this intro. The music should feel like a door opening — tense, mysterious, and full of potential. Let the silence speak as much as the notes. Create contrast, space, and movement. Avoid repetition, clichés, or predictable patterns. Make it sound like something that could only come from now, from here, from you.

The intro should:
- Begin with tension, using the drums to set mood and anticipation.
- Introduce the melody with space and restraint — don’t fill every beat.
- Let the bass and piano support the mood without overshadowing the voice.
- End with a sense of lingering, a question unanswered, a memory almost remembered.

Make it sound like a moment that matters.
