### **Bar 2–4: You – Tenor Sax (Melody – One short motif, make it sing)**

**Bar 2 (Beat 1–4):**  
- D (beat 1) – a single note, held with a slight breath, like a question.  
- C (beat 2) – a step down, a moment of hesitation.  
- D (beat 3) – return, but with uncertainty.  
- Eb (beat 4) – a half-step up, a challenge.

**Bar 3 (Beat 1–4):**  
- E (beat 1) – a half-step up, a step toward resolution.  
- F (beat 2) – a chromatic step, tension.  
- Eb (beat 3) – a retreat, a question.  
- D (beat 4) – return to the original note, but with more weight.

**Bar 4 (Beat 1–4):**  
- C (beat 1) – a step down, unexpected.  
- B (beat 2) – a half-step up, a whisper.  
- C (beat 3) – a return, but with space between.  
- D (beat 4) – the final note, left hanging — not resolved, not answered.

**Mood:** Simple, haunting, with space between notes. Each note should feel like a word in a sentence that’s not yet finished.
