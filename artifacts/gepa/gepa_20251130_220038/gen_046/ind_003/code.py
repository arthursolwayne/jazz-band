**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (subtle, almost breath-like)  
**Fill:** A single open hi-hat on the "and" of 4, fading out.

> *A whisper of rhythm. The room holds its breath.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
**Line:**  
F – G – Ab – Bb  
(Downbeat on F, chromatic approach to Bb)  
**Rhythm:**  
Dotted eighth on 1, eighth on 2, eighth on 3, sixteenth on 4  
**Dynamics:** Subtle, almost like a voice humming in the background.

> *The anchor is there, but not loud. Just *present*.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
**Comp:**  
On 2 and 4  
**Chords:**  
On 2: Fmaj7 (F, A, C, E)  
On 4: Bbmaj7 (Bb, D, F, A)  
**Gesture:** A left-hand root motion from F to Bb, with right hand playing a descending arpeggio on the 4th beat.

> *A shadow of harmony, not to guide, but to listen.*

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif:**  
F – Eb – D – rest  
**Dynamics:** *pp* (very soft), then *mf* on the D  
**Phrasing:** Start with a breath, then a cry — a phrase that ends in a question.

> *F, Eb, D — the beginning of a story you've never told before.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Band:**  
**Marcus:**  
Bb – C – Db – E  
(Chromatic approach to E, resolving back to F)  
**Diane:**  
On 2 and 4 again —  
2: Fmaj7  
4: C7 (C, E, Bb, D)  
**Little Ray:**  
Kick on 1 and 3  
Snare on 2 and 4  
Hi-hat on every eighth, slightly louder  
**You:**  
Repeat the motif, but now with a slight variation —  
F – Eb – D – **F**  
(Ending with a small upward motion, a breath of resolution, but not an answer)

> *The question is not answered. It is *felt*.*

---

### **Final Note:**  
The last note of the saxophone is held for a full beat — just a second — before the silence returns. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The room feels different. The story is only beginning.

**That’s the intro.**  
You don’t have to say anything else.  
You’ve already said everything.
