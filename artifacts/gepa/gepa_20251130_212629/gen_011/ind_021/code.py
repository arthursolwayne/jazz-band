---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Dynamic contrast, sparse but punchy.*

**Kick:** On beats 1 and 3 — punchy, dry.  
**Snare:** On beats 2 and 4 — snappy, crisp.  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note — light, even, but not overwhelming.  
**Fill:** A quick triplet on the "and" of 4, then silence.  
**Feel:** Tense, like the room holds its breath.

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*F7, Dø, Bb7, E7 — 7th chords, comp on 2 and 4.*

**Measure breakdown:**
- **Beat 1:** F7 (F, A, C, E♭) — open, dark, unresolved.
- **Beat 2:** Dø (D, F, A, C) — tension, chromatic pull.
- **Beat 3:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, A♭) — a shift, a question.
- **Beat 4:** E7 (E, G#, B, D) — suspense, a bridge to nowhere.

**Approach:** Play only the chords, no voicings or runs. Let them sit. Let them breathe.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line in F minor, chromatic passing tones.*

**Notes (F minor scale: F, G♭, G, A♭, A, B♭, B):**  
- **Beat 1:** F  
- **Beat 2:** G♭ → G (chromatic approach to G)  
- **Beat 3:** A♭ → A (chromatic approach to A)  
- **Beat 4:** B♭ → B (chromatic approach to B)  

**Rhythm:** Even eighth notes, downbeat on 1, 2, 3, 4.

---

### **Bar 2 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
*First note of the motif.*

**Phrase:** (F, A♭, B♭, F)  
**Rhythm:**  
- **Beat 1:** F – long, open, like a question.  
- **Beat 2:** A♭ – a half-step drop, tension.  
- **Beat 3:** B♭ – resolve, but not fully.  
- **Beat 4:** F – return, but not the same F. It's heavier now.

**Feel:** Let it hang for a moment. Let the room feel it. No vibrato, just air.

---

### **Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Same chords as Bar 2, but dynamically lower. Subtle, supporting.*

**Approach:** Play behind the sax, not against it. Let the space between the notes be part of the melody.

---

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, chromatic again, but this time bending toward resolution.*

**Notes:**  
- **Beat 1:** B  
- **Beat 2:** A → A♭ (chromatic drop)  
- **Beat 3:** G → G♭ (chromatic drop)  
- **Beat 4:** F – return, grounding.

**Rhythm:** Same as before.

---

### **Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
*Second half of the motif, with a twist.*

**Phrase:** (A♭, G, F, A♭)  
**Rhythm:**  
- **Beat 1:** A♭ – tension again, but different.  
- **Beat 2:** G – a step down, familiar but unexpected.  
- **Beat 3:** F – resolution, but not the same F.  
- **Beat 4:** A♭ – leaving it open, waiting.

**Feel:** This time, let the silence after the final note last longer. Let the audience feel the weight.

---

### **Bar 4 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Same chords again, but now a little louder, building.*

**Approach:** Build tension. Let the chords hint at a key change, but never arrive.

---

### **Bar 4 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, leading back to the tonic.*

**Notes:**  
- **Beat 1:** G♭  
- **Beat 2:** G  
- **Beat 3:** A♭  
- **Beat 4:** A – lead into the next phrase.

**Rhythm:** Same as before.

---

### **Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
*Final note of the motif, with a pause.*

**Phrase:** (F, rest, F, rest)  
**Rhythm:**  
- **Beat 1:** F – same note as the beginning, but now it feels like the end.  
- **Beat 2:** Rest – silence, a breath, a beat of nothing.  
- **Beat 3:** F – repeat, but with a new weight.  
- **Beat 4:** Rest – again, silence. Let it linger.

**Feel:** This is the moment. The moment he listens. The moment the room remembers.

### **Final Note:**

You stop. The room holds its breath. Wayne Shorter leans forward.

You don’t need to say anything. You’ve said it all in four bars.

**"The First Note"** — not a melody, but a question. And he’s listening.
