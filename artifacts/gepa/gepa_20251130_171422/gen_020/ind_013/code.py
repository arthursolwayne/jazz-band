**Title: "Edge of the Echo"**  
**Key: Dm**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit:**  
- Kick on beat 1 & 3  
- Snare on beat 2 & 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note  
- **Subtle fill on beat 3** (brushed snare, soft ride cymbal)  
- **Dynamics:** Start with a whisper, build to a tense undercurrent by bar's end  

**Rhythm:**  
`X X X X | X X X X | X X X X | X X X X`  
*But with a subtle, off-kilter push on beat 3. The tension is here, but it's not yet resolved.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**  

#### **Marcus (Bass – Walking Line, Chromatic Approaches)**  
**Line:**  
`Dm7 -> Gm7 -> Cm7 -> F7`  
**Notes (in Dm key):**  
`F (Dm7) | Eb (Gm7) | D (Cm7) | C (F7)`  
**Rhythm:**  
`& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4`  
*Walking with a chromatic twist on beat 2 of the bar (Eb instead of D). The anchor is firm but slightly off-center.*

---

#### **Diane (Piano – 7th Chords, Comp on 2 & 4)**  
**Left Hand:**  
- Rootless voicings:  
  - Bar 2: `Bb (Dm7)` on beat 2  
  - Bar 3: `F (Gm7)` on beat 2  
  - Bar 4: `B (Cm7)` on beat 2  
  - Bar 4: `E (F7)` on beat 4  
- **Right Hand:**  
  - Play a single-note line, mostly moving in half-steps, to avoid clashing with the sax.  
  - Notes: `F -> Eb -> D -> C` (on beats 1, 2, 3, 4)  
  - **Dynamics:** Start soft, swell on beat 4.

---

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax – Melody – Sparse, Expressive, with Space)**  
**Line:**  
`F | Eb | D | C`  
**Rhythm:**  
- **Bar 2:**  
  - `F` on beat 1 (legato, medium volume)  
  - `Eb` on beat 2 (slightly behind the beat, more breathy)  
  - `D` on beat 3 (soft, almost a whisper)  
  - **Leave the last note (C) hanging, unresolved, on beat 4**  
- **Dynamic:**  
  - Start with a breathy, low F  
  - Eb is more intense, like a question  
  - D is a breath before the answer  
  - **C is left open — a question, not an answer**

---

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- `F (Dm7) | Eb (Gm7) | D (Cm7) | C (F7)`  
- Chromatic approach on beat 2 (Eb again)  
- **Dynamics:** Slightly more assertive, as if the bass is pushing forward.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Left hand: `Bb (Dm7)` on beat 2  
- Right hand: `F -> Eb -> D -> C` (same as before, but with more urgency)  
- **Dynamics:** Swells into the middle of the bar, like a heartbeat.

**Dante (Tenor):**  
- **Melody:**  
  - `F -> Eb -> D -> C` (same as bar 2, but played again with more intent)  
  - **End the bar with the C still hanging — a question, not an answer.**

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- `F (Dm7) | Eb (Gm7) | D (Cm7) | C (F7)`  
- **Dynamics:** Slightly louder, as if the bass is trying to hold the space.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Left hand: `Bb (Dm7)` on beat 2, `E (F7)` on beat 4  
- Right hand: `F -> Eb -> D -> C` (same line, but ending with a short, sharp **C**, resolving the tension just slightly)

**Dante (Tenor):**  
- **Melody:**  
  - Play the **C** from the previous bar, but now **resolve it with a soft, long note on D**  
  - **D** on beat 4 — a breath, a sigh, a moment of clarity  
  - **Dynamic:** Breathe into the note, let it fade out

---

### **Final Note (Bar 4, Beat 4 – D)**  
- **Dante’s D** is held for a full second, fading out.  
- **Little Ray** plays a soft hi-hat on the last eighth, like the echo of the question.  
- **The room holds the sound.**  
- **Wayne Shorter leans forward.**

---

### **Emotional Arc:**  
- **Bar 1:** Silence, then tension. The question is asked.  
- **Bar 2:** The answer begins to form, but it’s not clear.  
- **Bar 3:** The question is repeated, with growing urgency.  
- **Bar 4:** A partial answer — a D that lingers, unresolved, but full of meaning.  

It’s not about resolution. It’s about the space between notes.  
It’s about the moment when a memory almost returns, but doesn’t.  
It’s about what’s *not* played.  

And it’s your opening.
