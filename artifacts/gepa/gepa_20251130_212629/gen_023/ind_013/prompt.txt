Create a piece that breathes — where space is as important as sound. Write for a quartet, with clear roles: the drums drive the rhythm with complexity and life, the bass walks the changes with chromatic motion and syncopation, the piano comps with 7th chords and restraint, and the saxophone shapes the melody with purpose and silence. Use rhythm as your guide — let the groove breathe, but keep it tight. Every instrument has a role — play with them, not against them. Build tension in the first bar with the drums alone, then let the full ensemble unfold in the second. Make the silence mean something.
