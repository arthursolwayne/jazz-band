**Title: "The Door at 2am"**  
**Key: F minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  

---

### **Bar 1 (0.0 – 1.5s): Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit Setup:**  
- Kick on **1** and **3**  
- Snare on **2** and **4**  
- Hi-hat on every **eighth note**  
- No cymbal crashes, no fills – just the rhythm.  

**Feel:** A slow build, like the sound of a door creaking open. The tension is in the silence between the beats. The hihat hums, the snare is sharp but quiet, the kick is deep and measured. It's a slow, deliberate entrance – a moment before the music begins.

**Rhythm:**  
Walking bass, quarter notes, with a subtle syncopation on the “and” of 3.  

---

#### **Diane (Piano – Comping on 2 and 4)**  
**Chords:**  
Fm7 on beat 2  
A♭m7 on beat 4  

**Voicings:**  
- Fm7: F, A♭, C, D♭  
- A♭m7: A♭, C, E♭, F  

**Left Hand:** Root-fifth-octave  
**Right Hand:** 7th above root, minor 7th above the 5th  
**Dynamic:** Soft but present, like a whisper just behind the bass.  

---

#### **You (Tenor Sax – Motif – Bar 2)**  
**Phrase:**  
F → G♭ → A♭ → **rest**  

**Notes:**  
F (on beat 1), G♭ (on beat 2), A♭ (on beat 3), **rest** (on beat 4)  

**Feel:** A question. It starts strong, moves into a dissonant G♭, resolves to A♭, then stops. You leave it hanging. The rest is the most important note.  

---

### **Bar 3 (3.0 – 4.5s): Full Ensemble – Development**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
B♭m7 → Cm7 → D♭m7 → E♭m7

**Chromatic approach on beat 2:**  
C → C♭ (chromatic descent)  

**Rhythm:** Same walking line, slightly more forward.  

---

#### **Diane (Piano – Comping on 2 and 4)**  
**Chords:**  
B♭m7 on beat 2  
D♭m7 on beat 4  

**Voicings:**  
- B♭m7: B♭, D♭, F, G♭  
- D♭m7: D♭, F, A♭, B♭  

**Left Hand:** Root-fifth-octave  
**Right Hand:** 7th above root, minor 7th above 5th  
**Dynamic:** Slightly louder, but controlled.  

---

#### **You (Tenor Sax – Motif – Bar 3)**  
**Phrase:**  
**rest** → F → G♭ → A♭  

**Notes:**  
**rest** (beat 1), F (beat 2), G♭ (beat 3), A♭ (beat 4)  

**Feel:** A return. The rest feels like a memory, the F like a familiar face, the G♭ and A♭ like a half-remembered truth. You’re not resolving yet – you’re echoing, not answering.

---

### **Bar 4 (4.5 – 6.0s): Full Ensemble – Resolution**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
E♭m7 → Fm7 → G♭m7 → A♭m7  
**Notes:**  
E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭  
**Chromatic approach on beat 2:**  
F → F♭ (chromatic descent)  

**Rhythm:** Same walking line, now with a little more urgency.  

---

#### **Diane (Piano – Comping on 2 and 4)**

**Voicings:**  
- E♭m7: E♭, G♭, B♭, C  
- G♭m7: G♭, B♭, D♭, E♭  

**Left Hand:** Root-fifth-octave  
**Right Hand:** 7th above root, minor 7th above 5th  
**Dynamic:** Rising slightly, building toward the end.

---

#### **You (Tenor Sax – Motif – Bar 4)**  
**Phrase:**  
F → G♭ → A♭ → **fermata on A♭**  

**Notes:**  
F (beat 1), G♭ (beat 2), A♭ (beat 3), **fermata on A♭** (beat 4)  

**Feel:** The resolution comes not in a chord, but in the breath. You hold the A♭, not to end the piece, but to make the audience feel the weight of what’s been said. It’s not a resolution, it’s a pause before the story continues.

### **Final Moment (6.0s):**  
Silence. The room holds. Wayne Shorter looks up. You’ve said enough.
