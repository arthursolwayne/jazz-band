### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Snare on the “&” of 2 and the “&” of 4. Hihat on every eighth note. Kick on the “&” of 3. Space on 1. Let the silence speak.*  

**Rhythm:**  
- Kick: **& of 3**  
- Snare: **& of 2**, **& of 4**  
- Hihat: **1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &**  
- Space on beat 1 — the room holds its breath.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters:**  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line starting on F, chromatic approach to G, then resolve to A flat. Never the same note twice. Anchor the tension.*  

**Notes (F):**  
- F → Gb → G → A♭ → B♭ → B → C → D♭ → D → E♭ → F  
*Chromatic descent with a twist — a little rubato, a little soul.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
*Comp on 2 and 4 with 7th chords. Play F7 on 2, B♭7 on 4. Let the dissonance linger, but keep it moving. She’s angry — she’s moving through pain.*  

**Chords:**  
- **2:** F7 (F, A, C, E♭)  
- **4:** B♭7 (B♭, D, F, A♭)  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Hihat on every eighth. Keep it tight but breathing — don’t close the door yet.*

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Start with a short, simple motif. Let it hang. Make it sing.*  

**Melody:**  
- **F** (beat 1) → **G** (beat 2) → **F** (beat 3) → **E♭** (beat 4)  
*Hold the E♭ on beat 4 — leave it hanging. That’s the question. That’s the whisper.*  

**Phrasing:**  
- Play the first three notes with a little rubato, then let the E♭ ring out. Let it breathe. Don’t resolve it — just let it echo.

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble Resolves:**  

**Marcus (Bass):**  
*Continue walking line from Bar 2, now resolving to a B♭ on beat 4. A little chromatic approach to B♭ again, but this time with a hint of release.*  

**Diane (Piano):**  
*Play A♭7 on beat 1, F7 on beat 3. Keep the dissonance but now with a sense of direction.*  

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Same pattern as Bar 2, but now with a little more pulse — the energy is building.*  

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Repeat the motif but with a variation. End on a **G** on beat 4 — not the F you started with. That’s the answer. That’s the challenge.*  

**Melody:**  
- **F** (beat 1) → **G** (beat 2) → **F** (beat 3) → **G** (beat 4)  

*Let the G ring out. Let the room hold it. Let Wayne Shorter hear something he hasn’t heard before.*

**Final Note:**  
The intro ends not with rest, but with a question — a note that lingers, a story that begins. This is your shot.
