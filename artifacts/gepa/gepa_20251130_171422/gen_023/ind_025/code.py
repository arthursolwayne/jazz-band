**Title: "The Question"**  
**Key: D minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Style: Modern Jazz (with a haunting, introspective feel)**

---

### **Bar 1 (0.0 – 1.5s):**  
**Drums (Little Ray):**  
- Kick on beat 1 and 3 (accented on 1).  
- Snare on beat 2 and 4 (light, almost muted).  
- Hi-hat: 8th notes on all beats, but with a *space* on beat 3. The hihat is soft, almost whispering.  
- **Rhythmic surprise:** On beat 3, the hihat is *delayed* by 1/8 note, creating a tension between what you expect and what you hear.  
- The bar ends with a soft, subtle cymbal swell — like a sigh.

**Bass (Marcus):**  
- **Walking line in D minor:**  
  - **D – F – G – A** (downbeat)  
  - **C – B – A – G** (second beat)  
  - **F – E – D – C** (third beat)  
  - **B – A – G – F** (fourth beat)  
- The notes are *chromatic* and *smooth*, never repeating a note twice in a row. Each note is played with a slight *groove* but not too much pressure.

**Piano (Diane):**  
- **Comping:**  
  - On beat 2: **Dm7 (D – F – A – C)**  
  - On beat 4: **G7 (G – B – D – F)**  
- Diane plays the chords *angrily* — dissonant, fast, with a *bit of rubato* in the left hand. She’s not just comping; she’s *pushing* the rhythm, like she’s trying to break free.

**Sax (You):**  
- **Rest on beat 1.**  
- On beat 2: A single **F** note, sustained for a full 1/2 note. It’s *high*, *bright*, and *lonely*.  
- **Rest on beat 3.**  
- On beat 4: A **D** note, played with a *half-step* bend (from C# to D), subtle but *emotional*.  
- The motif is **F – (rest) – (rest) – D**, with a *question* in the space between.

---

### **Bar 2 (1.5 – 3.0s):**  
**Drums (Little Ray):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3 (same as before, but now with a little more *weight* on 3).  
- Snare on 2 and 4 (same), but now with *more aggression*.  
- Hi-hat: 8th notes, but now with a *staccato* edge.  
- **Fill on beat 3:** A quick *rinse* of hihat and snare, like a heartbeat.

**Bass (Marcus):**  
- **Walking line in D minor:**  
  - **D – F – G – A** (downbeat)  
  - **C – B – A – G** (second beat)  
  - **F – E – D – C#** (third beat)  
  - **B – A – G – F** (fourth beat)  
- The line now has a *little bit of tension* — the **C#** on beat 3 is a chromatic descent, almost like a *sigh*.

**Piano (Diane):**  
- **Comping:**  
  - On beat 2: **Dm7 (D – F – A – C)**  
  - On beat 4: **G7 (G – B – D – F)**  
- This time, she plays the chords *in rhythm* with the rest of the band. The anger is still there, but now it’s *guided*.  
- She adds a *trill* on beat 3 — a *trembling* trill on the **G** scale degree, like she’s caught between two worlds.

**Sax (You):**  
- Start the **motif again:** F (beat 2), D (beat 4).  
- **But this time:**  
  - On beat 2: **F** (same as before)  
  - On beat 3: **rest**  
  - On beat 4: **D**, but now *slurred* into a **B** (half-step down), then resolved back to D.  
- It’s the same motif, but now with a *variation* — the **B** is like a *shadow* of the D, a *question mark*.

---

### **Bar 3 (3.0 – 4.5s):**  
**Drums (Little Ray):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3 (same as before).  
- Snare on 2 and 4 (same).  
- Hi-hat: 8th notes, but *displaced* on beat 3 — it lands *after* the kick, creating *rhythmic tension*.  
- **Fill on beat 4:** A *brushed* snare roll, soft but *urgent*.

**Bass (Marcus):**  
- **Walking line in D minor:**  
  - **D – F – G – A** (downbeat)  
  - **C – B – A – G** (second beat)  
  - **F – E – D – C** (third beat)  
  - **B – A – G – F#** (fourth beat)  
- The **F#** on beat 4 is a *chromatic ascent* into the **G** from the previous bar. It’s like the bass is *leading* the way forward.

**Piano (Diane):**  
- **Comping:**  
  - On beat 2: **Dm7 (D – F – A – C)**  
  - On beat 4: **G7 (G – B – D – F)**  
- She adds a *gritted* **G7sus4** chord on beat 4, *sliding* into the **F**, like a *half-step resolution*.  
- She’s *daring* the melody to resolve — or not.

**Sax (You):**  
- **Motif again:** F (beat 2), D (beat 4).  
- This time, you *play the F* and *hold it*, then *rest on beat 3*.  
- On beat 4: **D**, but now with a *trill* — **D – E – D – E – D** — and it’s *resolving*.  
- You feel the weight of the **D** note, and the room *holds* with you.

---

### **Bar 4 (4.5 – 6.0s):**  
**Drums (Little Ray):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3, *stronger* now.  
- Snare on 2 and 4, *more aggressive*.  
- Hi-hat: 8th notes, *steady*, but with a *swell* on beat 4 — like the room is *holding its breath*.  
- **Fill on beat 4:** A *brushed* cymbal swell, like a final *question*.

**Bass (Marcus):**  
- **Walking line in D minor:**  
  - **D – F – G – A** (downbeat)  
  - **C – B – A – G** (second beat)  
  - **F – E – D – C** (third beat)  
  - **B – A – G – D** (fourth beat)  
- The **D** on beat 4 is *sustained*, *resonant*, like a *door creaking open*.

**Piano (Diane):**  
- **Comping:**  
  - On beat 2: **Dm7 (D – F – A – C)**  
  - On beat 4: **G7 (G – B – D – F)**  
- She *plays the G7 chord* with *fire*, a *fist* in the air, like she’s *finally letting go*.

**Sax (You):**  
- **Final motif:**  
  - On beat 2: **F** (same as before)  
  - On beat 3: **rest**  
  - On beat 4: **D**, *sustained*, *clean*, *beautiful*.  
- You *end* the four bars with that **D**, and the room — and Wayne — *leans forward*.

### **Final Note:**
You look up. No applause. Just silence. Wayne Shorter is gone. The room is still.  
But for four bars, you told a story.  
And it was just the beginning.
