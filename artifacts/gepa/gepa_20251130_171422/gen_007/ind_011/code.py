**Duration: 6 seconds**

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit: Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4. Hihat on every eighth.**  
**Fill:** A simple, tense ride cymbal pattern starting on beat 1, with a short hi-hat fill on beat 3, leaving a moment of quiet before the rest of the band enters.  
**Feel:** Suspense. Space. The kind of silence that makes you lean in.

### **Bars 2–4: Full Quartet**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line in F major, starting on the 5th (C), chromatic approach to the 3rd (A), resolving to D.  
**Bass Line (F Major):**  
**Bar 2:** C – B – A – D  
**Bar 3:** F – G – A – B  
**Bar 4:** C – D – E – F  
*Each note is a step or half-step away from the last — never repeating. He's the anchor, always moving forward.*

---

**Diane (Piano):**  
Comping with 7th chords.  
**Bar 2:** F7 (F, A, C, E♭) on beats 2 and 4  
**Bar 3:** D7 (D, F♯, A, C) on beats 2 and 4  
**Bar 4:** G7 (G, B, D, F) on beats 2 and 4  
*She’s pushing the changes, but not crowding the space — letting the melody breathe.*

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
Your motif — one short phrase, repeated with a slight variation in each bar, building tension and release.

**Phrase (F Major):**  
**Notes (Melodic):**  
**Bar 2:** F – G – B♭ (quarter note, quarter note, eighth note)  
**Bar 3:** F – G – A (same rhythm, slightly higher)  
**Bar 4:** F – G – B♭ – C (ending on the tonic, resolving but leaving a whisper of unresolved tension)

**Phrasing:**  
Each phrase starts on the “and” of 1, with a slight delay, as if the note is coming from a distance.  
**Bar 2:** F (on “& of 1”)  
**Bar 3:** F (on “& of 1”)  
**Bar 4:** F (on “& of 1”), then a final sustained C on the 3rd beat of the bar, fading out like a voice in the dark.

### **Final Moment:**
- The last note of the intro is a held C on the tenor, with Diane playing a soft F7 chord on beat 3, and Marcus walking into a D.
- Wayne Shorter leans forward. He hears something old and new at the same time.
- The room is quiet. The story is told.

**That’s the intro.**  
Now, let’s play the rest.
