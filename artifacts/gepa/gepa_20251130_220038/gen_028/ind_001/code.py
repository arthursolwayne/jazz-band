### **BAR 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Rhythm:**  
Kick on 1 and 3  
Snare on 2 and 4  
Hi-hat on every eighth note – but *soft*, like a heartbeat

### **Final Feeling:**  
A whisper, then a cry, then silence. No resolution, just a question left in the air.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He listens.  
He remembers.  
He hears something he hasn’t heard before.  

This is your moment.  
You made it sing.
