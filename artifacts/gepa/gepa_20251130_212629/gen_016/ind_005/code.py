**INTRO — "Before the Storm"**  
*Key: D Major | Tempo: 160 BPM | Time Signature: 4/4 | Duration: 6 seconds*

---

**BAR 1: Little Ray (Drums) — 1.5 seconds**  
*All silence, except a single, low, resonant kick on beat 1. The room holds its breath. Then, on beat 3, a ghost note on the snare, soft and distant. The hi-hat is off. Just the kick on 1, a whisper on 3.*

---

**BAR 2: Marcus (Bass) — enters on beat 1**  
*Marcus plays a walking line in D major, but with a twist: he starts on the 5th (A), walks down chromatically to G, then resolves to D. The line is: A - G - F# - D (beat 1-4). He’s not just walking — he’s tracing the edge of a question.*

**Diane (Piano) — enters on beat 2**  
*She plays a D7 chord on beat 2, with a minor 9th (E) in the right hand. Then, on beat 4, she plays a B7 chord (D7 substitution), again with a minor 9th (C#). Her comping is sparse but sharp, like a blade cutting through the air.*

---

**BAR 3: You (Tenor) — enters on beat 1**  
*You play a simple, haunting motif: D - F# - E - D (quarter notes). The notes are long, with a slight rubato feel, like you're not sure if you should continue. It’s a question — a single phrase, unresolved, hanging in the air. You leave the last note (D) open, like you’re waiting for something to answer it.*

---

**BAR 4: Full Ensemble — You return on beat 1**  
*You repeat the motif, but this time you complete it with a half-step resolution: D - F# - E - F#. The tension is released, but not fully. Marcus walks again, Diane comps with a D7 on beat 2 and a B7 on beat 4. Ray kicks on 1 and 3, and the snare on 2 and 4, filling the bar with a taut, rhythmic pulse.*

---

**Ending:**
*You end on F#, leaving the final note lingering just a beat longer than the others. The room is silent. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The storm is coming.*

---

**That’s the intro.**  
It’s not a statement — it’s an invitation.  
And it’s just the beginning.
