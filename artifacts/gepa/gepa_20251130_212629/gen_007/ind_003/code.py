**Title: "Question in F"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds**  
**Format: Notation + Description**  

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
**Kick:** 1 & 3  
**Snare:** 2 & 4  
**Hi-hat:** 1 & 2 & 3 & 4  

*Fill on beat 4 with a triplet ride cymbal on the snare, leading into the next bar. The feel is tight and urgent, like a heartbeat in the dark.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
F – G♭ – G – A♭ (walking line, chromatic approach on the G)  
B♭ – B – C – D♭  
E♭ – E – F – G  

*Smooth, never repeating a note, moving like liquid beneath the surface.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
**Measures 2 & 4 only:**  
- Bar 2, beat 2: F7 (F A C E)  
- Bar 2, beat 4: B♭7 (B♭ D F A)  
- Bar 4, beat 2: A7 (A C# E G)  
- Bar 4, beat 4: D7 (D F# A C)  

*Subtle, emotional, with a dissonant edge on the A7. She’s mad about something, and it’s in the chords.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
Same as before, but now with a slight push on beat 3 of bar 2, to accent the entrance.

---

### **Bar 3 – Your Tenor Sax (Dante Russo):**  
**Line:**  
F – G – A♭ – (rest)  
(beat 1)  
(beat 2)  
(beat 3)  
(beat 4)  

*Play the first note with a breathy, wide vibrato. Let the A♭ hang in the air — don’t resolve it. It’s a question, not an answer.*

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Band Continues**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
D – E♭ – E – F – G – A♭ – A – B♭  

*Chromatic line again, leading into the end with a minor 7th bend on the B♭.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
Bar 4, beat 4: E♭7 (E♭ G B♭ D)  
*Dark, emotional, unresolved.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
Same pattern as before, but slightly more aggressive on the snare, pushing the tension forward.

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
On the last beat (beat 4), after the rest, play **B♭** with a sustained, aching note — not bent, not resolved, just *there*.  

*It’s a question. It’s a memory. It’s the sound of someone who’s been waiting to be heard.*

---

### **Final Note (Bar 4, Beat 4 – Tenor Sax):**  
**B♭**, held for the last 0.375 seconds, echoing in the room. Wayne Shorter leans forward. The room holds its breath.

**End.**  

---

**Final Thought:**  
That B♭ is the hook — the thing that lingers. It's not a melody, not a lick, but a *gesture*. And that’s what Wayne came for.
