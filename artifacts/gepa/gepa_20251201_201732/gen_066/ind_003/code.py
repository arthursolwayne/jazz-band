### **Bar 1: Little Ray – The Setup**  
**Drum Pattern:**  
- **Kick**: on beats 1 and 3  
- **Snare**: on beats 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat**: on every eighth note, soft and ghosted  
- **Fill**: On the last eighth of bar 1 (before beat 4), a quick, brushed cymbal roll, like a whisper  

**Mood**: Suspense. The room holds its breath.

### **Bar 2: Everyone Enters – Diane (Piano), Marcus (Bass), You (Sax)**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **D2 (MIDI 38)** – Root  
- **F2 (MIDI 41)** – Minor third  
- **G2 (MIDI 43)** – Fifth  
- Chromatic approach on **E2 (MIDI 40)** before resolving to D2 on the downbeat of bar 2  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 2 (comp on 2 and 4):**  
  - **Measures 2 (beat 2)**: **Dm7 (D-F-A-C)** – open voicing, left hand on D and F, right hand on A and C  
  - **Measure 2 (beat 4)**: **Gm7 (G-Bb-D-F)** – resolving tension, again open, with a slight rub against the Dm in the bass  

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Phrase (melody):**  
  - **Note values:**  
    - **Beat 1:** D (D4) – short, breathy, barely there  
    - **Beat 2:** F (F4) – a step up, lingering  
    - **Beat 3:** D (D4) – back down, but with a slight delay  
    - **Beat 4:** F (F4) – silence. No resolution, just the note hanging in the air  

**Mood**: A question. A memory. A feeling just out of reach.

### **Bar 3: Build – Diane and Marcus**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **D2 (MIDI 38)** – Root  
- **F2 (MIDI 41)** – Minor third  
- **G2 (MIDI 43)** – Fifth  
- Chromatic approach on **E2 (MIDI 40)** again, but this time held slightly longer  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 3 (comp on 2 and 4):**  
  - **Beat 2:** **Bm7 (B-D-F#-A)** – dissonant, but not chaotic  
  - **Beat 4:** **F7 (F-A-C-E)** – a dominant that doesn’t resolve, just lingers  

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Phrase (melody):**  
  - **Beat 1:** G (G4) – a half-step above F, a tension  
  - **Beat 2:** A (A4) – a rise, but not full  
  - **Beat 3:** G (G4) – back down, but with a little more weight  
  - **Beat 4:** silence again – no answer, just the space left behind  

**Mood**: The search continues. The question deepens. No resolution, but something is *there*.

### **Bar 4: The Moment – You End It**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **D2 (MIDI 38)** – Root  
- **F2 (MIDI 41)** – Minor third  
- **G2 (MIDI 43)** – Fifth  
- Chromatic approach on **E2 (MIDI 40)**, but this time, it resolves cleanly on **D2** at the end of the bar  

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Bar 4 (comp on 2 and 4):**  
  - **Beat 2:** **Dm7 (D-F-A-C)** – return to the tonic, but with a twist  
  - **Beat 4:** **Dm7 (D-F-A-C)** – same chord, but with a subtle rub against the bass line that never quite settles  

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Phrase (melody):**  
  - **Beat 1:** D (D4) – a return, but with a new voice  
  - **Beat 2:** F (F4) – the same step, but this time, you *hold* it  
  - **Beat 3:** D (D4) – back down  
  - **Beat 4:** F (F4) – and then... silence. Not an end, but a pause. A breath before the unknown.

**Mood**: The question is still unanswered. But the listener is *there*. They are listening. Wayne leans forward.

**Final Note**:  
You don’t resolve the chord. You don’t answer the question. You leave it open, but it *means* something. You play like you’re speaking to someone who understands. And you know, in that moment, that he does.
