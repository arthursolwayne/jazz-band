  "rationale": "The arrangement lacks essential jazz harmony elements, using only triads (C, D, G, Am, F) without 7th chords or extensions. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat playing on downbeats and 'and' of 2 and 4, not consistently driving the upbeats. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The trumpet is entirely silent, and there's no interplay between instruments. The overall feel is more like a music theory exercise than authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) for authentic jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes to saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in hihat pattern instead of straight quarters",
    "Use walking bass (roots, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) instead of just root notes",
    "Add ii-V-I progressions in bars 3-4 for authentic jazz harmony"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
