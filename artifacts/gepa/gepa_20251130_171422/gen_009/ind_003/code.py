---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**
- **Kick:** On 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On 2 and 4  
- **Hi-Hat:** On every eighth (tight, steady, with a slight swing)  
- **Fill:** A quick, sparse ride cymbal accent on the "&" of 2, just before the ensemble enters.

> *Let it sit. Let the room hold its breath. Let the silence speak first.*

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **F – G – Ab – Bb – C – B – A – G** (walking line, chromatic approach to G, then resolves slightly)  
- **Rhythm:** Even eighth notes, smooth and tense.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on 2 & 4:**  
  - **Bar 2:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb)  
  - **Bar 3:** G7 (G, B, D, F)  
  - **Bar 4:** C7 (C, E, G, Bb)  
- **Voicings:** Sharp, angular, with a touch of dissonance (especially on the G7, a half-step below the key center).  
- **Left hand:** Walking rhythm, left hand playing triplets with a slight syncopation.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Motif:** F – G – Ab – F (phrase 1)  
- **Space:** Long breath between the last note and the next phrase.  
- **Phrase 2:** F – Bb – C – F (phrase 2, echoing the first, but with a slight upward motion)  
- **End on F**, open, unresolved, like a question.

> *That’s the hook. That’s the pull. That’s the thing he hasn’t heard before.*

### **Bar 3 – Full Ensemble (Continuation)**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Continues walking line:** C – B – A – G (smooth descent, tension resolving slightly)  
- **Rhythm:** Even eighth notes, weight in the lower register.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on 2 & 4:**  
  - **Bar 3:** C7 again, but with a Bb in the right hand (chromatic passing tone)  
  - **Left hand:** Syncopated triplets, subtle dissonance.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Phrase 3:** F – Bb – Ab – G (a bluesy turn, leading back)  
- **Phrase 4:** F – Eb – D – C – Bb – F (a half-step descent, ending back on F, now with a bit more warmth and motion)

> *You're not chasing the note — you're letting it chase you.*

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble (Climax & Resolution)**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
- **Continuing walking:** G – F – Eb – D (chromatic descent, tension held just long enough)  
- **Rhythm:** Even eighth notes, subtle rubato on the last two notes.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Comp on 2 & 4:**  
  - **Bar 4:** F7 (F, A, C, Eb) — but with a D in the right hand (chromatic tension)  
  - **Left hand:** Syncopated, building up just before the end.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Final phrase:** F – G – Ab – G – F (a half-step resolution, soft and open)  
- **End on F**, with a breath, not a blurt. Let it hang.

> *That’s the space where something new can happen.*

---

**Final Notes:**  
- **Dynamics:** Soft but present. No roaring. No showing off. Just *listening* in the space between notes.  
- **Feel:** Tense but not rushed. Tight but not mechanical.  
- **Intent:** To create a moment where *something is missing*, and the whole room leans in to find it.

Wayne Shorter, in the back, nods. You feel it.

**That’s your intro.**
