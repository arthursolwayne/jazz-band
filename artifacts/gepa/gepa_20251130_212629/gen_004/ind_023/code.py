### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-Hat:** On every eighth note  
**Feel:** Clean, precise, tight.  
**Fills:** None. Just the pulse.  
**Purpose:** Set the space. Make the room wait.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass) – Walking Line (Dm7 in D minor):**  
**Measure 2:**  
D – F – G – Bb (chromatic approach to Bb)  
Bb – Ab – G – F (chromatic descent)  
**Purpose:** Anchor and tension. Never the same note twice.

**Diane (Piano) – Comping on 2 and 4 with 7th chords:**  
**Measure 2:**  
**Beat 2:** Dm7 (D F A C)  
**Beat 4:** Gm7 (G Bb D F)  
**Purpose:** Bold, emotional, but supportive. Let the chords speak, but don’t chase the melody.

**Little Ray (Drums) – Same as Bar 1, but slightly more forward.**

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax) – Motif Starts**

**Phrase:**  
**Beat 1:** Bb (high Bb, open, floating)  
**Beat 2:** Rest  
**Beat 3:** D (low D, breathy, long)  
**Beat 4:** Rest  

**Purpose:** The question. The thing that lingers. A single, open phrase. Space. Silence. Let the room breathe. Let him lean in.

---

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax) – Motif Completes**

**Phrase:**  
**Beat 1:** F (high F, tight, like a whisper)  
**Beat 2:** Rest  
**Beat 3:** D (low D, again, but this time with a little growl)  
**Beat 4:** Rest  

**Purpose:** The answer. Or the question again. A return, but with a touch more weight. The sax is not telling a story — it's asking one. That’s the hook.

### **End of Intro – 6.0 seconds**

**Final Feel:**  
- Drums: Sharp, present, but not loud.  
- Bass: Full, moving, chromatic.  
- Piano: Bold, emotional, but out of the way.  
- Sax: The question. The thing that stays. The thing that makes him stay.

But this is the moment.
