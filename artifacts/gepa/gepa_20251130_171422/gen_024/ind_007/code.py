**Title: "The Question"**  
**Key: D**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Hi-hats open on the off-beats (e & a &), soft and sparse, like a breath.*  
*Kick on beat 1, low and weighted — like the ground shifting under your feet.*  
*Snare on beat 3, sharp and questioning — like a raised eyebrow in the dark.*  
*Let the space between the hits breathe. This is the question — not answered, not yet.*

---

**Bar 2 – Full Ensemble:**  
*Marcus (Bass):*  
– D to C# to B to A on the downbeats, walking with chromatic tension.  
– B to A to G to F# on the upbeats. Chromatic lines, never repeating a note.  
– The bass line anchors but doesn’t resolve — it leans in, it waits.

*Diane (Piano):*  
– D7 on beat 2, F#7 on beat 4.  
– The chords are sharp, angular, like a memory breaking through.  
– She plays with space, leaving the 1st and 3rd beats open — she’s not chasing the melody, she’s listening.

*You (Tenor Sax):*  
– Open with a short, haunting motif:  
**D – F# – B (on 1 & 2 & 3)**  
– Let it hang on the 4th beat. Don’t resolve it. Don’t close it.  
– This is the question. This is the beginning.

**Bar 3 – Full Ensemble:**  
*Marcus (Bass):*  
– A to G to F# to E on the downbeats.  
– E to D to C# to C on the upbeats.  
– The line is winding, like a path through a forest — not leading anywhere, but moving.

*Diane (Piano):*  
– A7 on beat 2, C#7 on beat 4.  
– The chords are darker, more urgent.  
– She’s pushing, but not forcing — she’s responding to the saxophone’s question.

*You (Tenor Sax):*  
– Repeat the same motif, but a half-step lower:  
**C# – E – A (on 1 & 2 & 3)**  
– Again, let it hang. This time, it feels further away.  
– Like searching for something that’s just out of reach.

---

**Bar 4 – Full Ensemble:**  
*Marcus (Bass):*  
– C# to C to B to Bb on downbeats.  
– Bb to A to G# to G on upbeats.  
– Chromatic again, but now with a hint of resolution — almost there, but not quite.

*Diane (Piano):*  
– B7 on beat 2, D7 on beat 4.  
– She’s building, but still leaving room — the tension is rising.

*You (Tenor Sax):*  
– Repeat the motif once more, but now **resolve it**.  
**D – F# – B (on 1 & 2 & 3)**  
– This time, finish on the **B**, let it ring a little longer.  
– It’s not a full resolution, but it’s a whisper of one — the kind that makes Wayne Shorter lean forward.

**End of 4 Bars.**  
*The room is silent for a beat.*  
*The question has been asked. The answer is not yet known — but it’s coming.*
