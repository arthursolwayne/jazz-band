**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
*The room holds its breath.*  
He plays with the precision of a man who’s been waiting for this moment his whole life.  
The hihat is sharp, the kick is deep, the snare is crisp.  
No cymbal crashes, no fills — just a steady, driving pulse that says:  
*This is where it begins.*

---

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line in D minor, with chromatic approaches.  
He starts on D, walks down to C, then B♭, then B, then C again.  
It’s a question, a descent into the unknown.  
He never repeats a note.  
He plays:  
**D – C – B♭ – B – C – D – C – B**  
Grounded, but restless. The tension builds in the spaces between the notes.

---

**Bar 3 – Diane (Piano):**  
She comps on 2 and 4 with 7th chords.  
She plays a Bm7♭5 on beat 2, then a Gm7 on beat 4.  
Not pretty, not safe — just honest.  
Her chords are like a voice saying:  
*“I’ve been through this before, but I’m not done.”*  
She plays:  
**[rest] – Bm7♭5 – [rest] – Gm7**

---

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
Your moment.  
You play a short, angular motif that begins on D and ends on B.  
It’s not a scale run — it’s a feeling.  
You play:  
**D – F – G – B**  
Then you *hold* the B for a full beat — *just* long enough for Wayne Shorter to lean forward.  
It’s a question. It’s a memory. It’s a challenge.  
And when you finally resolve it, it’s not with a scale — it’s with a *rest*.  
You leave it hanging.  
You let the room breathe.  
You let Wayne decide.

**End of 4 Bars.**

*The room is silent for a beat — then Marcus walks into the next chord, Diane answers with a new tension, and Little Ray drives it forward.*

Wayne Shorter doesn’t move.  
But he’s listening.  
And he’s smiling.
