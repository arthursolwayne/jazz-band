**Title: "Whispers in the Dark"**  
**Key:** Dm7 (D minor 7)  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM  
**Time Signature:** 4/4  
**Style:** Modern jazz, introspective and groove-driven  

---

**Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5s):**  
**Drums (Little Ray):**  
- Kick: On 1 & 3  
- Snare: On 2 & 4  
- Hi-hat: On every 8th note  
- Let the hihat fall away on the "and" of 2 and 4, creating space.  
- Cymbal swells on 1 and 3, but soft.  
- No fills. Just rhythm. Just breath.

---

**Bar 2 (1.5 - 3.0s):**  
**Sax (Dante):**  
- Dm7: D – F – Ab – Bb  
- Play a short, four-note motif:  
  **D – F – Bb – Ab**  
  (Half note, eighth note, eighth note, half note)  
  Let it hang on the Bb, then resolve with a soft Ab on the downbeat of bar 3.  
- Use a breathy, smoky tone. Make it feel like it’s coming from deep in your chest.

---

**Bar 3 (3.0 - 4.5s):**  
**Bass (Marcus):**  
- Dm7: D – F – Ab – Bb  
- Play a chromatic walk:  
  **D – Eb – F – G – Ab – A – Bb – B** (all quarter notes, descending)  
- Keep it smooth, like a conversation. Let the notes slide, don’t pluck.  
- End on Bb, the same as the sax.

---

**Bar 4 (4.5 - 6.0s):**  
**Piano (Diane):**  
- Dm7: D – F – Ab – Bb  
- Play a simple comping pattern:  
  - On beat 2: Cm7 (C – Eb – Gb – Bb)  
  - On beat 4: Dm7 (D – F – Ab – Bb)  
  - Use a soft, rolling sound, like rain.  
- Don’t fill too much. Let the space be there.

**Sax (Dante):**  
- Repeat the motif: **D – F – Bb – Ab**  
- This time, let it end on the Ab, with a slight release, like a sigh.  
- Hold for a beat, then let it go.

---

**End of Intro (6.0s):**  
- Silence. No cymbal crash. Just the sound of the room breathing.  
- The story begins. The groove is set. The air is thick with possibility.

**That’s the intro.**  
Now, if Wayne Shorter leans forward, it’s because you made him feel something.  
If he looks away, you’ve still made your mark.  
Because this isn’t about perfection. It’s about truth.
