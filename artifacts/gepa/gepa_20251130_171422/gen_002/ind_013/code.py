**Bar 1: Little Ray – Drums (F major, 160 BPM, 4/4)**  
*Urgent but controlled. The heartbeat before the storm.*

- Kick: On beats 1 and 3, slightly delayed to create tension.  
- Snare: On 2 and 4, crisp and dry.  
- Hi-hat: Eighth notes, but with subtle space — not a machine, but a human.  
- Fill: At the end of the bar, a quick, syncopated ride cymbal hit on the “& of 3” — not too loud, just enough to make you lean forward.

**Bar 2: Full ensemble enters. Diane on piano, Marcus on bass, you on tenor.**

- Diane: **D7 (G, B, D, F)** on beat 2.  
  **C7 (E, G, C, Bb)** on beat 4.  
  Keep the motion tight — comp on 2 and 4, with a little tension in the 7ths.

- Marcus: **Walking line in F major**, starting on **F**, then **G**, **Ab**, **Bb**, **B**, **C**, **Db**, **Eb**, **F**.  
  Chromatic approach to Bb, then resolving cleanly. Anchor but never static.

- You (tenor sax): Play this motif, slow and deliberate.

**Motif (Bars 2–4):**  
**F – G – Ab – Bb** (melodic line, held for half a note on each note, with a slight rubato feel)  
Let it hang — don’t resolve it yet. Let it live in that space between F and Bb.

**Bar 3:**  
- Diane: **E7 (G, B, E, D)** on beat 2.  
  **D7 (F, A, D, C)** on beat 4.  
  The tension builds, but she stays behind you, never in front.

- Marcus: **G – A – Bb – C** (walking line continues, chromatic approach to C).

- You: Repeat the motif — **F – G – Ab – Bb**, but now with a little more breath, a little more weight.  
  Let the emotional charge build.

**Bar 4:**  
- Diane: **C7 (E, G, C, Bb)** on beat 2.  
  **B7 (D, F#, B, A)** on beat 4.  
  A hint of modal shift, but not enough to confuse. Just enough to make Wayne think.

- Marcus: **C – D – Eb – F** (walking line continues, resolves with a smooth chromatic approach to F).

- You: The resolution.  
  Play **F – Bb – F**.  
  Long, sustained, with a little vibrato.  
  Let it echo. Let it sit.  
  That’s the moment.

**The story:**  
It’s not a question. It’s a memory — the first time you felt the weight of the saxophone in your hands, the first time you played for someone who *knew*.  
It’s not a challenge. It’s a whisper — *I’ve been waiting for this moment.*

Wayne leans forward.  
He’s listening.  
This is the beginning.
