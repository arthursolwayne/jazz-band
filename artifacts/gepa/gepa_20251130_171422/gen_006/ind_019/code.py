**Key:** F minor  
**Tempo:** 160 BPM (4/4 time)  
**Duration:** 6 seconds (4 bars)  
**Mood:** A whisper of a memory — unresolved, searching, strange but familiar

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kit Setup:**  
- Kick: On beat 1 and 3  
- Snare: On beat 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat: On every eighth note (closed, soft, just enough to frame the space)  
- No cymbal crashes, no fills — just a tight, steady pulse, like a heartbeat in the dark  

**Feel:** The room holds its breath. The beat is there, but it’s not *pushing* — it’s *waiting*.

---

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Chords (Comping):**  
- Beat 2: **Bb7** (a half-step above Fm, a color that lingers)  
- Beat 4: **G7** (a dominant leading to Cm, but it doesn’t resolve — it *waits*)  

**Approach:** Diane plays each chord with a slight delay, letting the silence between notes feel like a pause in a conversation you don’t want to end.

### **Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- **Fm7** chord tone (F, Ab, D, Eb)  
- Chromatic descent: **Eb → D → C → Bb** (a half-step drop on the last note, a question mark)  
- Ends on **Bb**, suspended — not a resolution, but a suggestion of something else  

**Feel:** The bass is the voice of the night — steady, but never content.

---

### **Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif (Melody):**  
- **F** (soft, low, like a memory surfacing)  
- **Ab** (a half-step away — no resolution, just a whisper)  
- **D** (a long, sustained note — like you're holding onto something)  
- **F** (return to the start — but not the same F — it's softer, uncertain, like the first note of a dream)  

**Dynamics:** Start with a *piano* (very soft), build to a *mezzo-piano* on the D, then back to *pianissimo* on the final F. No crescendo — just tension and release in the space between notes.

**Phrase:** It’s not a melody — it’s a question. A memory that’s almost real.

---

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble**  
**Marcus:**  
- **Bb** (chromatic approach to C), then **C**, then **Bb** again (a tritone resolution that never lands)  

**Diane:**  
- **Eb7** on beat 2, **Ab7** on beat 4 — dissonant, unresolved, but moving  

**Little Ray:**  
- Kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4, hihat still on every eighth — the rhythm is *there*, but it’s not *driving* — it’s *supporting* the tension  

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
- The same motif again, but this time, you *leave it hanging* — the final **F** is not played. It's *implied*, like a breath held at the end of a sentence.

### **The Moment:**
Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
The room is quiet.  
The question lingers in the air.  
You didn’t play a note that was expected.  
You played a memory he almost remembered.  

And that’s enough.
