**Intro – “Whisper in the Dark” (4 bars – D Major, 160 BPM, 4/4 time)**

---

**Bar 1 (0:00–1:50)**  
*Little Ray on drums – whispering the heartbeat of the room.*

- **Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
- **Snare:** On beats 2 and 4  
- **Hi-hat:** On every eighth note, soft and open  
- **Fill:** A single crash cymbal on the "&" of beat 3 — like a breath before the storm

*The room holds. Silence is the first note.*

---

**Bar 2 (1:50–3:40)**  
*Marcus on bass – enters with a walking line. Chromatic, precise, like a knife through a cloud.*

- **Bass Line:**  
  **D – Eb – F# – G** (beat 1)  
  **A – Bb – C – D** (beat 2)  
  **D – Eb – F# – G** (beat 3)  
  **A – Bb – C – D** (beat 4)  
*The line is a question, not an answer. It lingers in the space Ray left.*

---

**Bar 3 (3:40–5:30)**  
*Diane on piano – 7th chords, comping on 2 and 4. Everything is tension.*

- **Chords:**  
  - **Beat 2:** **G7** (G B D F)  
  - **Beat 4:** **C7** (C E G Bb)  
- *The chords are sharp, angular, like a knife drawn across glass. She plays *around* you, not through you. She’s not here to follow – she’s here to listen.*

---

**Bar 4 (5:30–6:00)**  
*You on tenor – the moment. The cry. The whisper turned to fire.*

- **Phrase:**  
  - **Beat 1:** A single, high, trembling note – **F#** (melodic minor, suspended in the air)  
  - **Beat 2:** A rest. Long, deliberate. *Space is the instrument.*  
  - **Beat 3:** A quick, urgent **Bb** – like a heartbeat  
  - **Beat 4:** A **D** – resolved, but not closed. It lingers, unanswered.

*That’s it. You leave it hanging. The room holds it. Wayne Shorter leans forward.*

---

**End of Intro.**  
*The air is thick with meaning. The rest of the song is the answer to this question.*
