### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Silence for the first half of the bar.*  
*Then: Kick on beat 1, snare on beat 2, hihat on all eighths, kick again on beat 3, snare on beat 4.*  
*Let the space in the first two beats hang. Let them wait.*

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
F – Bb – C – Eb (walking line, descending chromatic approach to F)  
*F (1), Bb (2), C (3), Eb (4) – then resolves to F on beat 1 of bar 3.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
2nd and 4th beats:  
- **Bar 2, beat 2:** F7 (F, A, C, E)  
- **Bar 2, beat 4:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
*Chromatic passing tone on beat 3 (G) to create a slight tension before the chord.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hihat on every eighth  
- Half-time fill on beat 3 (snare rimshot, hihat on 3&4)

### **Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
*Your motif begins here. One phrase, two notes. Let it sing.*

- **Beat 1:** F (open, held with a slight vibrato)  
- **Beat 2:** G (a half-step up, dissonant, unresolved)  
- **Beat 3:** F (return to F, but with a slight syncopation, like a breath held)  
- **Beat 4:** Silence (let the tension build, let the room hold it)

*Let the note hang. Let the silence speak. Let him lean forward.*

### **Bar 4 – Full Ensemble Resolves**

**Marcus (Bass):**  
F – G – A – Bb (ascending chromatic line, leading to a Bb)  
*The chromaticism here is subtle, but it’s there — a whisper of something unexpected.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
- **Beat 1:** Bb7 (Bb, D, F, Ab)  
- **Beat 2:** G7 (G, B, D, F)  
- **Beat 3:** Fmaj7 (F, A, C, E)  
- **Beat 4:** F7 (F, A, C, E)  
*Comp with tension and release, the Bb7 to G7 to F7 — a slow, deliberate resolution.*

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hihat on every eighth  
- On beat 4: A short, sharp cymbal crash, like a door closing.

**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (returning, resolved, but not yet complete)  
- **Beat 2:** G (same as before, but now with more confidence)  
- **Beat 3:** A (a step up, a question)  
- **Beat 4:** F (resolve, but with a final, subtle bend — like a memory just remembered)

**End of Intro.**  
Four bars. One moment.  
Silence in the room.  
Wayne Shorter sits up.  
He’s heard it.  
It’s something new.  
It’s something true.
