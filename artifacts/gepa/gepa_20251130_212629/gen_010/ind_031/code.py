### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Right Hand:**  
- **1:** Kick on beat 1  
- **2:** Snare on beat 2  
- **3:** Kick on beat 3  
- **4:** Snare on beat 4  
**Left Hand:**  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note, light but steady.  
- On beat 3, a quick fill: **snare + hihat** (slightly behind the beat for tension)  
- **Purpose:** Set a dark, urgent groove. Leave space. Make the silence feel like a question.

### **Bar 2 – Enter Diane (Piano)**  
**Chords (comping on beats 2 and 4):**  
- **Beat 2:** **F7** (chromatic approach from E)  
- **Beat 4:** **Cm7** (chromatic approach from B)  
**Left Hand:** Walking bass line (Marcus is still playing, but Diane’s left hand is just comping and outlining the harmony)  
**Right Hand:**  
- Play a **chromatic run** up from **Dm7** to **F7**, resolving on the 4th beat.  
- **Purpose:** Establish the key but with a twist. Let the tension build, not resolve.

### **Bar 3 – Enter Marcus (Bass)**  
**Walking line (chromatic approaches):**  
- **D – Eb – F – G** (Dm7)  
- **F – G – A – Bb** (F7)  
- **C – Db – Eb – F** (Cm7)  
- **F – G – A – Bb** (F7 again, leading back)  
**Purpose:** He’s the anchor, but his line is restless, like it’s searching for something. The chromatics hint at the melody, but don’t give it away.

### **Bar 4 – Enter Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif (Dm):**  
- **Bar 4, beats 1–2:**  
  - **D (beat 1)** – smooth, breathy, like the first word of a story  
  - **F (beat 2)** – a step up, with a slight delay, like you’re holding back  
- **Bar 4, beats 3–4:**  
  - **Eb (beat 3)** – quick, unexpected, like a punch to the ribs  
  - **D (beat 4)** – back to the root, but not resolved — it’s a question still  
**Purpose:** You start the melody, but you don’t finish it. You set the hook, then you leave it hanging. That’s the art.

### **Final Effect:**  
After four bars, the room is hushed. Diane’s left hand is still walking. Marcus is holding the tension. Ray’s hihat is a ticking clock. You’re the only one who knows what comes next — but you don’t tell Wayne Shorter. You just let the silence speak, and in that silence, you’ve asked the question only he can answer.

**The intro is done.**  
Now, the real music begins.
