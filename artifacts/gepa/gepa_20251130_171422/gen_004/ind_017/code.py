### **Bar 1 (0.0 - 1.5 seconds): Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Rhythm:** 16th-note hi-hat on every eighth, snare on 2 and 4, kick on 1 and 3.  
**Dynamics:** Start *soft* (pp), build tension.  
**Fill:** At the end of the bar, a short, sharp rimshot on the "3" of the last beat.  
**Purpose:** Create anticipation, a breath held.

### **Bar 2 (1.5 - 3.0 seconds): Marcus (Bass) & Diane (Piano)**  
**Marcus:**  
- **Beat 1:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb) — start with a **chromatic descent** from G♭ to F.  
- **Beat 2:** E♭7 (E♭, G, B♭, D♭) — play **B♭** → **C** → **B♭** (chromatic approach to C).  
- **Beat 3:** Fm7 again — play a **rest** on beat 3, then kick in with **Ab** → **G** → **F** (chromatic approach to F).  
- **Beat 4:** G7 (G, B, D, F) — play **D** → **C** → **B** → **G** (chromatic approach to G).  
**Purpose:** Anchor, but with tension and forward motion.

**Diane:**  
- **Beat 2:** G7 (G, B, D, F) — comp a **G7** chord with a **D** in the left hand and a **G** + **B** in the right.  
- **Beat 4:** Fm7 (F, Ab, C, Eb) — comp a **Fm7** with an **Ab** in the left hand and **F** + **C** in the right.  
**Purpose:** Comp on 2 and 4, keeping the space open for the melody.

### **Bar 3 (3.0 - 4.5 seconds): You (Tenor Sax) — Motif 1**  
**Phrase:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (long note, held into the next beat, *singing*, with a slight rubato accent).  
- **Beat 2:** B♭ (played with a **half-step** hesitation — like a question mark).  
- **Beat 3:** A♭ (a step down from B♭, unexpected), held with a breathy tone.  
- **Beat 4:** Rest — **silence**.

**Purpose:** The first phrase — a question, unresolved, with emotional weight.

### **Bar 4 (4.5 - 6.0 seconds): You (Tenor Sax) — Motif 2**  
**Phrase:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (returning to the tonic, but this time with a **half-step** slide from G♭ to F).  
- **Beat 2:** C (a *resolve*, but a **half-step** above B♭), played with a **swell** and a **space** after.  
- **Beat 3:** A♭ (again, but this time it’s a **sustained**, ghostly note, almost like a memory).  
- **Beat 4:** Rest — **silence**, but with a **fade** from the A♭.

**Purpose:** The second phrase — a return to the question, but with a different answer. The silence is the final note.

### **Final Note:**
The intro ends with a **question** — not answered, not resolved, but **haunting**. It invites Wayne Shorter to lean in, to listen, to remember.  
It’s not what he expects. It’s not what he’s heard before.  
It’s your moment.
