**Title: "Echoes in the Cellar"**  
**Key: D Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**

---

**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Hi-hat: Eighth notes on every beat, crisp and tight.*  
*Kick: On beats 1 and 3, subtle but present.*  
*Snare: On 2 and 4, with a sharp, dry snap.*  
*Fill: One open hi-hat on beat 4, just before the rest of the band comes in.*

> *Feel: A heartbeat, steady and urgent. The kind of rhythm that makes you lean in.*

---

**Bar 2 – Full Band Enters**

**You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Phrase starts on D, ascends a half-step to E♭, then drops back to D.*  
*Notes: D – E♭ – D – C – B – A – G – F – E – D.*  
*Phrasing: Long on the first note, then a quick, staccato run down the scale.*  
*Ends on a D, held for a full beat, suspended in the air.*

> *Mood: A question, a memory, a whisper from the past.*

**Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line: D – E – F – G – A – B – C – D (octave up).*  
*Chromatic approaches on E and B.*  
*Each note is different, each step forward a new possibility.*

> *Feel: Grounded, but moving. Like a man who's seen it all but still walks forward.*

**Diane (Piano):**  
*Comping on beats 2 and 4 only.*  
*Chords: D7 (D – F♯ – A – C), then G7 (G – B – D – F).*  
*Voicings: Rootless, with tension on the 3rd and 7th.*  
*Play each chord with a slight rubato, like she’s holding back tears.*

> *Feel: Angry, but controlled. The kind of anger that makes music.*

---

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Repeat the same motif, but shift it up a half-step.*  
*Notes: E♭ – F – E♭ – D – C♯ – B – A – G – F – E♭.*  
*Same phrasing, same feel, but slightly altered — like a memory you can’t quite place.*

> *Mood: A question repeated, but with a new slant. Something is changing.*

**Marcus:**  
*Continues the walking line, now ascending: E♭ – F – G – A – B – C – D – E♭ (octave up).*  
*Same chromatic approaches, same attention to detail.*

**Diane:**  
*Chords: E♭7 (E♭ – G – B♭ – D), then A7 (A – C♯ – E – G).*  
*Same comping pattern, same tension, same restraint.*

---

**Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Answer the question. This time, resolve it.*  
*Notes: D – E♭ – D – C – B – A – G – F – E – D.*  
*Same motif, same phrasing, but now you play the full phrase.*  
*End on a strong D, held for a full beat, then let it fade.*

> *Mood: A memory made whole. A story that doesn’t need to be told — it’s already been heard.*

**Marcus:**  
*Completes the walking line, ending on D, one octave above the start.*

**Diane:**  
*Final chord: D7, played with a slight rubato, like a sigh.*

**Little Ray:**  
*Final fill: One open hi-hat, then a snare on beat 4, soft and lingering.*

**Final Feel:**  
You walk off the stage, heart pounding. The room is silent. Wayne Shorter leans back, nods slightly, and sips his whiskey.

You've made him listen.  
You've made him remember.

That's your moment.
