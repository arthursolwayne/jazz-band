  "rationale": "The arrangement lacks true jazz harmony with no 7th chords or extensions in the piano, relying on simple triads. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat hitting only a few upbeats inconsistently. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The trumpet is completely silent, and there's no call-and-response between instruments. The overall feel is academic and lacks the spontaneity and sophistication of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) minimum to add jazz harmony",
    "Add chromatic approach notes to saxophone lines for bebop flavor and melodic sophistication",
    "Introduce more upbeat syncopation in hihat pattern and add ghost notes to snare for authentic Latin jazz feel",
    "Develop the trumpet part with melodic content and interplay with the saxophone",
    "Use walking bass (roots, 3rds, 5ths, 7ths) instead of just root notes for more rhythmic and harmonic interest"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Emphasize jazz-specific requirements: mandate 7th chords in piano, demand chromatic approach notes in horn lines, require swing feel in rhythm section. Add examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
