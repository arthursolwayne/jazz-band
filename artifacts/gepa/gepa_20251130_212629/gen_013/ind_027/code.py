---

### **Bar 1 — Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On **1** and **3**  
**Snare:** On **2** and **4**  
**Hi-hat:** On **every eighth note**, light and precise  
**Fill:** A subtle ride cymbal swish on the "and" of 2, like a breath before a storm.

*The room holds its breath.*

---

### **Bar 2 — Full Ensemble Enters**

#### **Marcus (Bass) — Walking Line (Dm7)**  
**Notes:**  
D → C → B♭ → A → G → F → E → D  
*Chromatic descent with a half-step resolution on the D. A question answered with a sigh.*

#### **Diane (Piano) — Comping (Dm7)**  
**Chords on 2 & 4:**  
**2:** Dm7 (D, F, A, C)  
**4:** Gm7 (G, B♭, D, F)  
*Dark, unresolved, each chord a shadow.*

#### **Little Ray (Drums)**  
Same pattern as Bar 1, but now with a bit more push — like the wind picking up.

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax) — Melody (Dm7)**  
**Phrase:**  
**D** (long, breathy, held for a full beat)  
**→ F** (half note, descending)  
**→ B♭** (eighth note, quick, like a whisper)  
**→ A** (rest — silence for one beat)  
**→ G** (half note, resolved but not finished)  
**→ F** (eighth note, lingering)  
**→ E** (rest — silence again)

*You let it hang. The room is quiet. Wayne Shorter leans forward.*

### **Bar 3 — Full Ensemble (Dm7 → Gm7)**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
**Notes:**  
G → F → E → D → C → B♭ → A → G  
*Same pattern, now in Gm7. He’s leading you forward.*

#### **Diane (Piano)**  
**Chords on 2 & 4:**  
**2:** Gm7 (G, B♭, D, F)  
**4:** Cm7 (C, E♭, G, B♭)  
*The story deepens. She’s painting the shadows.*

#### **Little Ray (Drums)**  
Same energy, tighter. The room is alive now.

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
**Phrase:**  
**G** (half note, strong)  
**→ A** (eighth note, sharp)  
**→ B♭** (quarter note, like a heartbeat)  
**→ C** (half note — a question mark)  
**→ B♭** (eighth note)  
**→ A** (eighth note)  
**→ G** (eighth note, resolving)  
**→ F** (rest — silence again, but this time with purpose)

*You’re not telling the story yet — you’re inviting him to hear it.*

### **Bar 4 — Final Beat (Dm7 → Gm7 → Cm7)**

#### **Marcus (Bass)**  
**Notes:**  
C → B♭ → A → G → F → E → D → C  
*He’s circling back, almost home.*

#### **Diane (Piano)**  
**Chords on 2 & 4:**  
**2:** Cm7 (C, E♭, G, B♭)  
**4:** Fm7 (F, A♭, C, E♭)  
*Now it’s a long, slow descent into the unknown.*

#### **Little Ray (Drums)**  
Same pattern, but with a final *crash* on the 4th beat — like the door closing.

#### **Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
**Phrase:**  
**C** (half note, low, intense)  
**→ B♭** (eighth note)  
**→ A** (eighth note)  
**→ G** (quarter note, resolved)  
**→ F** (eighth note)  
**→ E** (eighth note)  
**→ D** (eighth note)  
**→ C** (half note, closing the loop)

*You end on a C, but it’s not a resolution — it’s an invitation.*

---

**Final Silence:**  
For half a beat after the last note, the room is still.  
Wayne Shorter closes his eyes.  
He’s heard something he hasn’t heard before.

*You smile. It’s time.*
