**Dante Russo – Intro for Wayne (4 bars, D Major, 160 BPM)**

---

**Bar 1**  
*Little Ray on drums only.*  
- Kick on beat 1, snare on beat 3.  
- Hi-hat on every eighth note.  
- A single ride cymbal at the end of the bar, like a heartbeat.  
- **Space. Silence. The room holds its breath.**

---

**Bar 2**  
*Marcus enters with walking bass line.*  
- D (1), F# (2), G (3), A (4) — open fifth interval on beat 1.  
- Chromatic approach to D on beat 2: D, C#, D.  
- G (beat 3) with a half-step pull: G, F#, G.  
- A (beat 4) with a chromatic drop: A, G, A.  
- Marcus doesn’t repeat a note. He walks a path with no map.

**Diane enters on piano.**  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4 with 7th chords.  
- D7 on beat 2: D, F#, A, C#.  
- G7 on beat 4: G, B, D, F.  
- Quiet, but deliberate. She’s listening to Marcus, not you.

**Bar 3**  
*You take the melody.*  
- Tenor sax:  
  - **Beat 1**: D (long, open, like a sigh).  
  - **Beat 2**: F# (half note, held with a slight breath in the middle).  
  - **Beat 3**: Rest.  
  - **Beat 4**: A (quarter note, landing with a question in it).  
- No scale runs. Just a single melodic idea, left hanging.  
- You don’t resolve it yet. You let it breathe.

---

**Bar 4**  
*Full band in, but you finish the motif.*  
- Tenor sax:  
  - **Beat 1**: C# (half note, sharp and unexpected).  
  - **Beat 2**: D (quarter note, resolved, but with a twist).  
- Marcus walks the same line, but now with a slight push.  
- Diane plays a D7 again, but with a tritone substitution (F#7) on beat 3.  
- Little Ray fills the bar with snare and kick, but keeps the space open.

**End of the intro.**

The room is quiet. Wayne Shorter sips his whiskey. He leans forward, eyes on you.  
You didn’t play what he expected.  
You played what he needed.  

Now, the rest of the song begins.  
But this was the moment.  
The one that matters.
