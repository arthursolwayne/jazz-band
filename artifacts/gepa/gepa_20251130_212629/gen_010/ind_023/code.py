**Intro – "Echoes in the Cellar"**  
**Key: F minor**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Duration: 6 seconds (4 bars)**  

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray – Drums (Setup)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note  
**Fill:** A soft, open-handed roll into the downbeat of bar 2  

- Subtle, but present. The rhythm is there, but it’s waiting. A heartbeat in the dark.

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus – Bass (Walking Line)**  
**Phrase:**  
E♭ – D – C – B♭  
A – G – F – E♭  
(Chromatic approach to Fm, then descending, never repeating a note)  

**Diane – Piano (Comping on 2 & 4)**  
**Chords:**  
- On beat 2: Gm7♭5 (leaning into the tension)  
- On beat 4: Cm7 (a half-step lower than Fm, creating a pull)  

**Little Ray – Drums (Continuing)**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hat on every eighth  
- A slight swell in dynamics, a bit more energy, but still controlled  

---

### **Bar 3: You – Tenor Sax (Motif – First Half)**  
**Phrase:**  
A♭ – B♭ – C – D♭  
(A descending motif from A♭ to D♭, resolving on D♭, which is a chromatic half-step above C)  

- Play it **soft and slow**, like a question being asked in a hushed voice.  
- Let the note hang on D♭, **no resolution**, just a pause in the air.  
- This is the "search" – the moment before the answer, the moment before the story begins.  

---

### **Bar 4: You – Tenor Sax (Motif – Second Half)**  
**Phrase:**  
C – B♭ – A♭ – G♭  
(Now the motif is inverted, descending from C to G♭)  

- Play this half a beat later than expected, **drifting in** like a memory returning.  
- Let the final note (G♭) fade out, almost silent.  
- The ensemble holds for a split second, then fades into the next song.  

---

### **Final Atmosphere:**  
- The room is still, but not empty.  
- The tension of the intro lingers, like a question that hasn’t been answered yet.  
- Wayne Shorter shifts slightly in his chair, the whiskey in his hand still, but his eyes are open.  

This is the moment.  
This is what happens when you play with the truth in your fingers.
