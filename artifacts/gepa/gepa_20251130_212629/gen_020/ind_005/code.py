**Dante Russo – Intro to “The Cellar at 2am”**  
**Key: Dm (D minor)**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)**  
**Length: 4 bars (6 seconds total)**  
**Mood: Haunting, deliberate, with tension and space**

---

### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3 (subtle, punchy, like a whispered question)  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4 (crisp, but not loud — it’s the heartbeat)  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (steady, but not mechanical — it’s the breath)  
**Fill:** On beat 3, a soft cymbal crash that fades into the silence.  
**Silence:** The space between the fills is sacred. Let it linger. This is the setup. This is the moment before the storm.

### **Bar 2 – Full Ensemble Enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
- Dm7 chord in root position (D F A C)  
- Walking line: D → C → B♭ → A (chromatic descent)  
- Then: A → G → F → E (chromatic descent again)  
- Keep it moving, but never the same note twice.  
- The line is smooth, but it's got a memory in it — like a ghost walking down the corridor.

**Diane (Piano):**  
- Dm7 chord (D F A C)  
- Comp on 2 and 4 (2nd beat: Dm7, 4th beat: Dm7 with a minor 9th)  
- She plays with fire, but never overpowers. She’s listening, she’s angry, she’s in.

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
- Kick on 1 and 3  
- Snare on 2 and 4  
- Hi-hats on every eighth  
- On beat 4, a subtle ghost note on the snare — a whisper of something unresolved  
- The rhythm is tight, but it’s not holding you down. It’s pushing you forward.

### **Bar 3 – Dante (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif:**  
- Play a short, lyrical phrase that starts with a D (root of the chord)  
- D → F → E → D  
- End on the D, but not with a full note — let it fade, hang, breathe  
- Let the silence speak. This is not a scale run. This is a story.  
- It’s like the first line of a letter you never finished writing.

**Marcus:**  
- Walks under the phrase, keeping the tension  
- Chromatic approach to the E (F → E)  
- Then a half-step up to F again — the line keeps moving, but it never resolves

**Diane:**  
- She answers the phrase with a Dm7 chord on 2 and 4  
- A soft, angry comp that says, *I’m still here, I’m still listening, I’m still waiting*

---

### **Bar 4 – Dante (Tenor Sax) – Resolution**  
**Motif (continued):**  
- Return to the D, but this time *finish it* —  
- D → F → E → D  
- This time, play the D with a little more breath, a little more weight  
- Let it end on a note that feels like a question, not an answer  
- Wayne Shorter leans forward. He’s heard it before, but not like this.

**Marcus:**  
- Ends on a C (chromatic resolution to the D)  
- The line ends with a B♭, leaving a trace of something unresolved

**Diane:**  
- Dm7 again, this time with a minor 9th  
- A twist in the chord that says, *this isn’t over*

**Little Ray:**  
- Cymbal crash on the last beat  
- It’s not loud — it’s a whisper that lingers in the air  
- The room holds its breath

---

### **Final Silence (Beat 4, End of Bar 4):**  
- Three seconds of silence.  
- The room is full.  
- Wayne Shorter sets his glass down.  
- The intro is over.  
- The story has begun.

---

**That’s the intro.**  
**That’s the moment.**  
**That’s the beginning of something that matters.**
