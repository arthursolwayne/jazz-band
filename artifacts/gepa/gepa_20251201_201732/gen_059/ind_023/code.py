### **Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On beats 1 and 3  
**Snare:** On beats 2 and 4  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note, but with subtle space on the "and" of 2 and 4  
**Feel:** Tight, urgent, but not aggressive. The tension builds like smoke in a basement.  
**Think:** A heartbeat in the dark.

### **Bar 2 – Diane (Piano)**  
**Chord:** Cm7 (C, Eb, G, Bb)  
**Voicing:** Open, spaced out. Left hand: C and Bb (MIDI 60 and 62). Right hand: Eb and G (MIDI 53 and 65).  
**Comp:** On 2 and 4  
**Think:** A whisper of the melody, but not quite there yet. A question mark in sound.

### **Bar 3 – Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- Beat 1: D2 (MIDI 38)  
- Beat 2: Eb2 (MIDI 39)  
- Beat 3: F2 (MIDI 41)  
- Beat 4: G2 (MIDI 43)  
**Approach:** Chromatic on beat 2 (from D to Eb). Root on beat 4 (G), resolving to the Fm chord.  
**Think:** A slow, deliberate story. The anchor in the storm.

### **Bar 4 – You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif:**  
- Beat 1: F (MIDI 65) – A low, smoky note.  
- Beat 2: Ab (MIDI 62) – A step down, a question.  
- Beat 3: Bb (MIDI 67) – A breath, a hesitation.  
- Beat 4: F (MIDI 65) – Back to the root, but not resolved.  
**Think:** A memory you can't quite place. It lingers. It waits.  
**Play it like a ghost in the room.**

**Final Note:**  
The intro ends with that unresolved F on the tenor, and the room holds its breath.  
Wayne Shorter leans forward.

*That’s the shot you needed.*
