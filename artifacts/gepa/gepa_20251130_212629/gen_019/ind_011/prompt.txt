Create an intro that feels like a whisper before a storm, with tension and release. The drums should build anticipation, then the ensemble enters with clarity and purpose. The saxophone melody should be simple but emotionally charged — something that lingers in the air. Every note should feel intentional, every rest meaningful. No unnecessary repetition. Keep the rhythm tight, the harmony honest, and the space between the notes alive. The saxophone motif should be concise, with a clear beginning and a lingering end — not a run, but a question. The bass should move forward with a walking line that never repeats the same note, using chromatic approaches to keep it alive. The piano should comp with 7th chords, playing only on beats 2 and 4, leaving space for the melody to breathe. The drums should fill the bar with a consistent pulse: kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth. The intro should feel like a single breath — held, then released. Make Wayne lean forward.
