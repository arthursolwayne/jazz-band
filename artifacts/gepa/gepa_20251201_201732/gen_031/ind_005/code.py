**Intro: "Whispers in the Cellar"**  
**Key: Dm (D minor)**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**0:00 – 1:50s**

- **Kick**: On beat 1 and 3, punchy and tight.  
- **Snare**: On beat 2 and 4, crisp and dry.  
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth note, light and clean.  
- **Fills**: One quick, ascending roll on the snare on the “& of 3” that feels like it’s reaching for something.  
- **Space**: The hi-hat is the heartbeat, but the kick and snare are the pulse. Leave a half-second of silence before each kick to build tension.

---

### **Bars 2–4: Full Quartet**  
**1:50s – 6:00s**

---

#### **Bar 2: Tenor Sax (Dante) – Melody**

- **Motive**: A short, ascending triplet, starting on **D**, resolving on **F**, leaving **G** as the unresolved note.  
- **Notes**:  
  - **D (1)** → **F (2)** → **G (3)** (triplet on beat 2)  
  - Let the note **G** linger on the offbeat, breathy and uncertain.  
- **Dynamics**: Soft, like a whisper, but with intent.  
- **Feel**: As if the saxophone is asking a question — not demanding an answer, but testing the space.

---

#### **Bar 2: Marcus (Bass)**  
- **Walking line**:  
  - **D (1)** → **F (2)** → **G (3)** → **C (4)**  
  - Then a **B♭** chromatic approach to **C** on the “& of 4”  
- **Style**: Subtle, steady, with a little tension in the chromatic approach.  
- **Tone**: Warm, smooth — the anchor of the room.

---

#### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**  
- **Chord**: **Dm7 (D F A C)**  
- **Voicing**: Open, spaced out —  
  - **D in the left hand (low)**  
  - **F and A in the right hand** (mid-range)  
  - **C on the “& of 2”**  
- **Comping**: Only on beat 2 and 4.  
- **Feel**: The chord is open and searching — like a door left ajar.

---

#### **Bar 3: Tenor Sax (Dante) – Melody (Again)**  
- **Motive repeats**, but this time ends on **F**, holding it slightly longer.  
- **Notes**:  
  - **D (1)** → **F (2)** → **G (3)** (triplet again)  
  - This time, the **F** feels like a pause, a breath, like the question is now waiting for a reply.  
- **Dynamic**: Slightly louder than before, with more texture — still searching, but more confident.

---

#### **Bar 3: Marcus (Bass)**  
- **Walking line**:  
  - **F (1)** → **A (2)** → **B♭ (3)** → **D (4)**  
  - Then a **C** chromatic approach to **D** on the “& of 4”  
- **Same style**: Grounded, with subtle tension.

---

#### **Bar 3: Diane (Piano)**  
- **Chord**: **B♭m7 (B♭ D F A)**  
- **Voicing**:  
  - **B♭ in the low left hand**  
  - **D and A in the right hand** (mid-range)  
  - **F on the “& of 2”**  
- **Comping**: Again on beat 2 and 4.  
- **Feel**: A shift in mood — a little darker, a little more urgent. The chords are still searching, but the direction is clearer now.

---

#### **Bar 4: Tenor Sax (Dante) – Melody (Again)**  
- **Motive returns**, but now it’s more resolved.  
- **Notes**:  
  - **D (1)** → **F (2)** → **G (3)** (triplet)  
  - This time, the note **G** is held — not resolved, but *almost* resolved.  
- **Dynamic**: A little louder, with more air in the sound — like the question is finally being heard.

---

#### **Bar 4: Marcus (Bass)**  
- **Walking line**:  
  - **A (1)** → **C (2)** → **D (3)** → **F (4)**  
  - Then a **E♭** chromatic approach to **F** on the “& of 4”  
- **Same grounded, chromatic style** — still the anchor.

---

#### **Bar 4: Diane (Piano)**  
- **Chord**: **F7 (F A C E)**  
- **Voicing**:  
  - **F in the left hand (low)**  
  - **A and E in the right hand (mid-range)**  
  - **C on the “& of 2”**  
- **Comping**: On beat 2 and 4.  
- **Feel**: This chord is the first real hint of direction — like the question is now leading somewhere.

---

### **End of Intro**

- **Little Ray** holds the **hi-hat on the "1" of the next bar**, but doesn’t play the kick or snare.  
- There’s a half-second of silence — a breath — before the next phrase begins.  
- The room is quiet. The air is thick with possibility.

**Wayne Shorter** leans forward.
