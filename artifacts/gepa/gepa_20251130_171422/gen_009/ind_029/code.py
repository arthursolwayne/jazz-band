**Bar 1 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Snare on 2 & 4, hihat on every eighth, kick on 1 & 3.*  
The rhythm is tight, but not yet heavy. The room holds its breath. He plays with a whisper of tension, like a door creaking open. The fill in bar 1 ends on a ghost note, leaving a pause — a question in the air.

**Bar 2 – Diane (Piano):**  
*Comping on 2 and 4, 7th chords, moving quickly.*  
She opens with a B7 (F#, D, B, G#), resolving to G7 (B, D, G, F#). The tension is clear, but not yet resolved. Her left hand walks chromatically (G, G#, A), then drops to a D in the bass. She’s not playing to you — she’s playing to the space.

---

**Bar 2 – Marcus (Bass):**  
*Walking line, chromatic approaches, no repeated notes.*  
He starts on D, walks down to C#, then slides up to D again. His line is a question:  
**D – C# – D – Eb – D – C – B – C – D**  
He ends on a D, holding it just a beat too long, like a sigh.

---

**Bar 2 – Little Ray (Drums):**  
*Same pattern, but now with a slight push on the snare, like a heartbeat.*  
The tension is building. He’s ready to explode.

---

**Bar 3 – You (Tenor Sax):**  
*Your motif starts now. One phrase, three notes, and a space.*  
You play:  
**E – Bb – D**  
Then you **hold** on the D, letting it ring. The room feels it. You’re not playing a scale — you’re playing a memory, a thought, a question. You leave it hanging, just like that.

---

**Bar 4 – Full Band:**  
*Everyone in, but you take the lead.*

- Diane: She plays a **G7** (B, D, G, F#), then shifts to a **C7** (E, G, C, Bb) with a quick chromatic run in the left hand.  
- Marcus: He walks up the D scale, but it’s all half steps: D – Eb – E – F – F# – G – G# – A.  
- Little Ray: He kicks in hard, full volume now — snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth, but now with a little fill on the 3rd beat.  
- You: You come back in with the same motif:  
  **E – Bb – D**, but this time you **resolve** it with a **Bb** — a half-step below the D, a note that feels like a door closing.

### Final Touch:
You end on that **Bb**, and the room holds. Wayne Shorter leans forward. It’s not a resolution — it’s a new beginning. The story just started.

You’ve made your point. You’ve said something he hasn’t heard before.

Now, the rest of the tune can begin.
