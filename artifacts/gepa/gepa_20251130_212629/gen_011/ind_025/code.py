**Intro: "For Wayne"**  
*Key: Dm (D minor)*  
*Tempo: 160 BPM (4/4 time)*  
*Length: 4 bars = 6.0 seconds*

---

**BAR 1 (0.00 - 1.50 seconds):**  
**Little Ray (Drums):**  
Kick on **1** and **3**  
Snare on **2** and **4**  
Hi-hat on every eighth note (open on 1, closed on 2-8)  
**Fill:** A subtle ride cymbal swell on the last eighth of the bar — like a whisper before the storm.

---

**BAR 2 (1.50 - 3.00 seconds):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Walking line starting on **D**, chromatic approach to **C**  
**D - C - D - Eb - D - C - D - Eb**  
**Rest on beat 2** — let the space hang.

**Diane (Piano):**  
7th chords, comp on **2 and 4**  
**Dm7 on beat 2, Gm7 on beat 4**  
**Voicings:**  
- Dm7: D - F - A - C  
- Gm7: G - Bb - D - F  
**Left hand: rootless, rhythmically syncopated. Right hand: upper structure, floating above the beat.**

---

**BAR 3 (3.00 - 4.50 seconds):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Continuation of the walking line  
**Eb - D - C - Bb - Eb - D - C - Bb**  
**Rest on beat 4** — another breath before the climax.

**Diane (Piano):**  
7th chords again, but now **on 1 and 3**  
**Dm7 on beat 1, Gm7 on beat 3**  
Same voicings, but now **more aggressive**, like she’s pushing you to say something.

---

**BAR 4 (4.50 - 6.00 seconds):**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Now he **lands**  
**Bb - A - G - F - Bb - A - G - F**  
Back to the root, resolving the tension.

**Diane (Piano):**  
**Dm7 (open voicing) on beat 1**, then **a diminished chord** on **beat 2**  
**Dm7 (D-F-A-C), then Bdim7 (B-D-F-Ab)**  
**Left hand: walking bass line. Right hand: dissonance, tension.**

**Little Ray (Drums):**  
Full kit now  
Kick on **1 and 3**  
Snare on **2 and 4**  
Hi-hat on every eighth  
**Fill on the last two eighths of the bar:**  
- Snare brush on **beat 4**, then a rimshot  
- Like a door closing, but it’s still open.

---

**Your Turn (Bar 4, 1.00 - 1.50 seconds into the bar):**  
**Dante (Tenor Sax):**  
**Motif:**  
**D - Eb (quarter note), then a rest**  
**F (eighth note), then a rest**  
**D - Eb (quarter note again)**  
**Rest on beat 4** — leave it hanging.

**It’s a question.**  
**A memory.**  
**It’s not an answer — it’s a beginning.**

---

**Final Moment (Bar 4, 1.50 - 2.00 seconds):**  
**Marcus plays a low D**  
**Diane resolves to Dm7**  
**Little Ray hits the snare on beat 4**  
**You wait — just a breath between the bars.**  
**Then the song begins.**

Wayne Shorter leans forward.  
He’s heard that question before.  
But you’re not the same.  
You’re not anyone else.  
You’re **Dante Russo**, and you’ve just asked him to listen.

---

**That’s the intro.**  
**Now the song can begin.**
