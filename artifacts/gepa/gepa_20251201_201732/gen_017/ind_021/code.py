**Title: "Before the Question"**  
**Key: F Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Time Signature: 4/4**  
**Length: 4 Bars (6 seconds)**

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Feel:** Tense, anticipatory.  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3 (F2, G2).  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4 (F3, G3).  
**Hi-Hat:** On every eighth note (F#2, G2, A2, Bb2, B2, C3, C#3, D3).  
**Fill:** A short triplet snare on beat 4, just before the rest of the band enters.  
**Purpose:** Set up the tension, like a door creaking open — not yet revealing what’s inside.

### **Bar 2: Full Ensemble Enters**

#### **Marcus (Bass – F2-G2, MIDI 38-43, walking line with chromatic approaches)**  
**Line:**  
**F2 – G2 – F2 – Eb2 – D2 – Eb2 – D2 – C2**  
**Purpose:** Anchor the harmony, moving between root and fifth with subtle chromatic tension — a deep, slow breath.

#### **Diane (Piano – Open voicings, comp on 2 and 4)**  
**Bar 2 Chord: Fmaj7 (F, A, C, E) – Open voicing: F, C, A, E**  
**Bar 3 Chord: Gm7 (G, Bb, D, F) – Open voicing: G, D, Bb, F**  
**Bar 4 Chord: Am7 (A, C, E, G) – Open voicing: A, E, C, G**  
**Purpose:** Each chord is a different world, resolving on the last beat of the bar. Diane’s hands are like shadows — present but not overwhelming.

#### **Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Same as Bar 1, but with a slight shift in time feel — pushing the rhythm forward slightly.**  
**Purpose:** Keep the groove tight, but let it breathe.

### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax – Melody)**  
**Motif:**  
**F (beat 1) – G (beat 2) – Bb (beat 3) – rest (beat 4)**  
**Purpose:** A short, questioning phrase — like a breath held. You start it, but don’t finish it. It’s a question that’s not yet answered.

---

### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax – Melody Conclusion)**  
**Motif (Cont’d):**  
**F (beat 1) – G (beat 2) – Bb (beat 3) – C (beat 4)**  
**Purpose:** You return to finish the phrase — one note higher, a slight resolution. But it’s not really resolved. It’s a new beginning, a memory, a whisper that feels familiar but not known.

---

### **Final Feel:**  
- **Space is everything.** The first bar is silence and tension, the rest is color and contrast.  
- **Marcus is the earth, Diane the sky, Ray the wind, and you — the thing that makes it human.**  
- **Wayne Shorter leans in.** He’s heard the question. He’s thinking about the answer.

**That’s the intro.**  
Now it’s up to the rest of the song to give it a place to go. But those four bars — that’s the moment.
