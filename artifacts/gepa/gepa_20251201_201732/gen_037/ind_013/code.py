**Bar 1: Little Ray – Drums (Setup, 0:00–1:50)**  
- Kick: On beats 1 and 3.  
- Snare: On beats 2 and 4.  
- Hihat: On every eighth note.  
- *But he holds back on the last eighth of the bar — a subtle pause, a breath before the storm.*  

**Bar 2: Diane – Piano (Comp, 1:50–3:40)**  
- Chord: **F7sus4** (F, Bb, C, E)  
- Open voicing, left hand on F and C, right hand on Bb and E.  
- Comp on beat 2 and 4.  
- *She plays it with a slight rub, like she's pushing back against something.*  

**Bar 3: Marcus – Bass (Walking Line, 3:40–5:30)**  
- Root: F (D2)  
- Chromatic approach: E (D1)  
- Then: F (D2), C (C2)  
- Chromatic approach: B (B1)  
- Then: C (C2), G (G2)  
- Chromatic approach: F# (F#1)  
- Then: G (G2)  
- *Walking line that feels like a heartbeat, steady, but with a question in the space between the notes.*  

**Bar 4: You – Tenor Sax (Melody, 5:30–6:00)**  
- Play a short motif:  
  - **F** (beat 1)  
  - **Bb** (beat 2)  
  - Rest (beat 3)  
  - **F** (beat 4)  
- *Short, simple, but with a yearning in the space. The F on beat 1 is clear, the Bb is a step outside, the rest is silence, the F on beat 4 is a return — like a question that’s not answered yet.*

**Final Note:**  
The intro ends with the F on the last beat — a sound that lingers in the room, and maybe even in Wayne’s mind. It’s not a resolution. It’s a beginning.
