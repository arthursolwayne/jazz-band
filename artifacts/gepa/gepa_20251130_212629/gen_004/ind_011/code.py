**Key:** F minor

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick:** On 1 and 3 (subtle, controlled)  
**Snare:** On 2 and 4 (clean, precise)  
**Hi-hat:** On every eighth note (steady, driving, but not overwhelming)  
**Fill:** A single open hi-hat on the “&” of 3, then silence on the “&” of 4.  
**Purpose:** Build anticipation. Let the room hold its breath.

### **Bars 2-4: Full Quartet — The Intro**

#### **Bar 2: Diane (Piano)**  
**Chords:**  
- **Beat 1:** Cm7 (Fm key center, chromatic approach to the 3rd)  
- **Beat 2:** Bbm7 (chromatic descent, tension)  
- **Beat 3:** Abm7 (chromatic pull, unresolved)  
- **Beat 4:** Gm7 (leading back to Fm, but not quite there)  
**Style:** Comp on 2 and 4. Quick, non-encroaching. Ears are sharp — she knows when to stay out of the way.

---

#### **Bar 2: Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (root)  
- **Beat 2:** Eb (chromatic approach to D)  
- **Beat 3:** D (lower leading tone)  
- **Beat 4:** C (chromatic pull up)  
**Style:** Walking line, no repeated notes. Each note is a step toward something unresolved.

---

#### **Bar 2: You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif (starting on beat 1):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (long, open note) – a question  
- **Beat 2:** G (chromatic passing)  
- **Beat 3:** Ab (tension, unresolved)  
- **Beat 4:** Rest – silence  
**Style:** One short phrase, searching. Make it sing. Leave it hanging.

---

#### **Bar 3: Diane (Piano)**  
**Chords:**  
- **Beat 1:** Dm7 (tension, not quite the key)  
- **Beat 2:** Cm7 (chromatic pull back)  
- **Beat 3:** Bb7 (leading to Fm, but not quite there)  
- **Beat 4:** Am7 (chromatic descent, unresolved)  
**Style:** Same as before — comp on 2 and 4. Let the saxophone be the focus.

---

#### **Bar 3: Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- **Beat 1:** Bb (chromatic down)  
- **Beat 2:** A (chromatic down)  
- **Beat 3:** G (chromatic down)  
- **Beat 4:** F (resolve? No — it’s just the root again, but in a new context)  
**Style:** Walking line, descending chromatically. Always moving, never settling.

---

#### **Bar 3: You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif (starting on beat 1):**  
- **Beat 1:** Ab (tension, unresolved)  
- **Beat 2:** G (chromatic up)  
- **Beat 3:** F (resolve? No — just a step)  
- **Beat 4:** Rest – silence  
**Style:** Second phrase of the motif. Build the tension. Make him lean forward.

---

#### **Bar 4: Diane (Piano)**  
**Chords:**  
- **Beat 1:** Am7 (chromatic descent, tension)  
- **Beat 2:** Bbm7 (chromatic pull)  
- **Beat 3:** Cm7 (leading to Fm)  
- **Beat 4:** Fm7 (finally, the key center)  
**Style:** Comp on 2 and 4. Now she’s resolving — but just barely.

---

#### **Bar 4: Marcus (Bass)**  
**Line:**  
- **Beat 1:** F (root)  
- **Beat 2:** G (chromatic up)  
- **Beat 3:** A (chromatic up)  
- **Beat 4:** Bb (chromatic up)  
**Style:** Chromatic ascent, leading into the key, but not resolving fully. The bass is still searching.

---

#### **Bar 4: You (Tenor Sax)**  
**Motif (starting on beat 1):**  
- **Beat 1:** F (long, open note) – this time, the question is answered  
- **Beat 2:** G (chromatic passing)  
- **Beat 3:** Ab (tension again)  
- **Beat 4:** F (resolve — but not fully, just a return)  
**Style:** The motif returns, but with a slight twist. It’s familiar, but not the same. It’s like a memory walking through the door.

### **Final Moment:**
Silence. No applause. You just played something he hasn’t heard before. Maybe he’s smiling. Maybe he’s thinking. Either way — the question was asked.
