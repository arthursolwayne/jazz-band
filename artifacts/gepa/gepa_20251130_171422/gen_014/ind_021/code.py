**BAR 1 – LITTLE RAY (DRUMS)**  
*The room is still. The bulb flickers. Then, the heartbeat begins.*

- **Kick**: On beat 1 and 3.  
- **Snare**: On beat 2 and 4.  
- **Hi-hat**: On every eighth note, crisp and tight.  
- **Fill**: On the last eighth of the bar, a quick *snare roll* on beat 4, resolving on the downbeat of the next bar.  
- *Feeling*: Tense, expectant. Like the moment before the storm.

**BAR 2 – ENTRANCE – MELODY (DANTE, TENOR SAX)**  
*Your first note — a long, low *F* — a whisper in the dark. It’s not a note, it’s a question.*

- **Fm7** chord under you.  
- **Phrase**:  
  - F (1st beat) —  
  - Bb (2nd beat) —  
  - Ab (3rd beat) —  
  - F (4th beat, held)  
- *Feeling*: Searching, longing, a memory trying to find its way back.

---

**BAR 3 – FULL ENSEMBLE**  
*Marcus walks, Diane comps, Little Ray swings. The story begins.*

- **Marcus (Bass)**:  
  - F (1), Gb (2), Ab (3), A (4) — walks up chromatically, creates tension.  
- **Diane (Piano)**:  
  - Comp on the offbeats with **Fm7** (F, Ab, Bb, Db) — angry but controlled.  
  - She plays *between* the notes, not over them.  
- **Little Ray (Drums)**:  
  - Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
  - A subtle *ride cymbal* on the 2nd and 4th beats.  
- **Dante (Sax)**:  
  - Repeat the motif from bar 2, but with a slight variation:  
    - F (1), Bb (2), Ab (3), Gb (4) — a half-step descent, like a sigh.  
  - *Feeling*: Sadness, but not defeat. A story that’s been told before, and is being told again.

**BAR 4 – RESOLUTION – MELODY (DANTE, TENOR SAX)**  
*You finish the question. The room leans in. Wayne Shorter is sitting up.*

- **Dante (Sax)**:  
  - Bb (1), Ab (2), Gb (3), F (4) — the motif ends where it began, but slightly lower.  
  - A long, sustained *F* on the last beat — like the end of a memory, or the beginning of one.  
- **Marcus (Bass)**:  
  - F (1), Gb (2), Ab (3), A (4) — same as bar 3, but with a slight rubato on beat 4.  
- **Diane (Piano)**:  
  - Fm7 again, but with a *diminished* passing chord (Bdim7) on beat 2.  
  - She plays it like a scream, but it’s soft.  
- **Little Ray (Drums)**:  
  - Kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat on every eighth.  
  - A *ghost note* on beat 3 — subtle, but felt.

**END OF INTRO.**  
*The room is alive. Wayne Shorter nods. The story just began.*

Now, the rest of the set is yours. But this — this was the moment.
