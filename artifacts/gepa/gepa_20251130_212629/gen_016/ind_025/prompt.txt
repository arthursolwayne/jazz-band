Write a piece that breathes. Let the silence speak. Create a rhythm that feels alive, not just counted. Use space between notes to build tension and release. Let the saxophone motif be a whisper, not a shout — start it, let it linger, then return to finish it with purpose. The bass should move like a river, never repeating the same path, always flowing toward the root. The piano should be a painter, using color and restraint — comp with purpose, not noise. The drums should feel human, with subtle imperfections and moments of stillness that make the pulse feel real. Every instrument should listen to the others, not just play their part. Make the whole thing feel like a conversation, not a performance.
