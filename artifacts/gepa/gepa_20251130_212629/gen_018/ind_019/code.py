**Key: D Major**  
**Tempo: 160 BPM**  
**Style: Modern Jazz – Tense, Intimate, Urgent**

---

### **Bar 1 – Saxophone (Melody):**  
**Phrase: A question, held in the air.**  
**Notes:**  
D₄ – F#₄ – G#₄ – E₄ – (rest)  
*Let the saxophone begin on the offbeat of the first bar, soft and breathy, with a sense of hesitation.*

---

### **Bar 2 – Bass (Walking Line):**  
**Notes:**  
C#₄ – D₄ – C₄ – B₃ – A₃  
*Chromatic descent with tension, each note unique and purposeful.*

---

### **Bar 3 – Piano (Comping):**  
**Chords (rootless 7th chords):**  
Dmaj7 – F#m7 – G#m7 – Em7  
*Play each chord on the “and” of the beat, with a light, driving rhythm. Use a half-time feel to push the forward motion without obscuring the space.*

### **Bar 4 – Drums (Rhythmic Foundation):**  
**Kit Focus:**  
- **Snare:** On all downbeats, with a crisp, urgent snap.  
- **Hi-hat:** Offbeats, with a tight, syncopated feel.  
- **Kick:** On beats 1 and 3, with a subtle, resonant pulse.  
- **Cymbal Fills:** A ghost cymbal swell on the last 8th of the bar, building tension toward resolution.

### **Bar 4 – Saxophone (Answer):**  
**Phrase: The return to the question — answered with yearning.**  
**Notes:**  
D₄ – F#₄ – G#₄ – E₄ – D₄  
*End cleanly on the final beat, suspended in the space before the storm.*

### **Ensemble Exit:**  
All instruments hold their last note for one full beat, then fall away into silence.  
The space between the notes is heavy, alive, pregnant with what's coming next.

**Final Note:**  
This 4-bar intro is not just a beginning—it’s a prelude to something larger, something raw and waiting to be unleashed. The music breathes, holds, and releases, like the calm before the eye of the storm.
