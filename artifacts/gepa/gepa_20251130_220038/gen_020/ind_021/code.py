Alright, let's walk through it. This is the intro — 4 bars, Dm key, 160 BPM, 4/4 time. We've got a story to tell in 6 seconds, and it has to be something Wayne Shorter notices. Let’s do this.

---

### **Bar 1: Little Ray (Drums)**  
**Kick on 1 and 3**  
**Snare on 2 and 4**  
**Hi-hat on every eighth**  
**Fills:** A subtle triplet snare fill on the “& of 3,” just before the kick on 4. It’s tight, it’s open, it makes you wait. No cymbals, just the heartbeat.

---

### **Bar 2: Everyone enters**  
**Marcus (Bass):**  
Starts on **D**, walks **D → Eb → E → F** — chromatic, moving up, steady. Then **F → G → Ab → A**, resolving to **Bb** on beat 4. It’s not a standard bass line — it’s a question walking down the hallway.

**Diane (Piano):**  
**Bar 2:** Comp on beats 2 and 4 with **Dm7** (D-F-A-C). No added tension, just solid, but with a touch of space between chords. The left hand walks the root and fifth.  
**Bar 3:** She shifts to **Gm7**, then **Cm7**, each on the 2nd and 4th beats. It’s a pivot, like a door opening.

**Little Ray:**  
Same as bar 1, but now with more energy. The fills are a little more restless, like the room is starting to breathe.

**You (Sax):**  
**Bar 2:** First note — a **D** on beat 1, held for a full beat. Then a **Bb** on the “& of 2,” a **C** on the “& of 3,” and a **D** again on beat 4.  
It’s simple, but it’s not *safe*. The Bb is unexpected, the C is a half-step above, and the D returns — it’s like someone asking a question and then stopping.

### **Bar 3:**  
**Marcus:**  
**Bb → B → C → Db**, sliding back down to **C** on beat 4. It’s like the bass is unsure where it’s going, but it’s still moving.

**Diane:**  
Comp on beats 2 and 4 with **Bb7**, then **Eb7**. The chords are moving, but not resolving. It’s tension, not resolution.

**Little Ray:**  
Same rhythm, same energy, but now the fills are more aggressive, like the room is getting restless.

**You (Sax):**  
**Bar 3:** A **C** on beat 1. Then a **Bb** on “& of 2,” a **D** on “& of 3,” and a **Bb** on beat 4. It’s the same motif from Bar 2, but transposed and slightly altered. It’s like the question reappearing — but with a new slant.

---

### **Bar 4:**  
**Marcus:**  
**C → Db → D → Eb**, ending on **Eb** on beat 4. It’s a slow climb, like the bass is leading toward something.

**Diane:**  
Comp on beats 2 and 4 with **F7** and **B7**, each chord a step away from the last. She’s building tension without resolution.

**Little Ray:**  
Same rhythm, same energy, but now the fills feel like they’re pushing the beat forward. It’s the last gasp before the melody arrives.

**You (Sax):**  
**Bar 4:** The **C** on beat 1 again — then the **Bb**, **D**, **Bb** motif. But this time, you hold the **Bb** on beat 4. You don’t finish the thought. You leave it hanging. It’s the question. The moment before the answer. The moment that matters.

### **Final Thought:**
This isn’t a resolution. It’s a setup. You’ve left the room breathing, and now it's Wayne’s turn to answer. You’ve told a story — not with words, but with the space between them. You’ve played *something* he hasn’t heard before.

And in that silence, you’ve made him lean forward.
