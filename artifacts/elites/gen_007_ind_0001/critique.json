  "rationale": "The arrangement uses basic triads in the piano and bass (C, D, G) without 7th chords or extensions, resulting in a lack of jazz harmonic sophistication. The rhythm section has minimal syncopation with hihat hitting only a few upbeats, and the snare lacks ghost notes or syncopated accents. The saxophone has some melodic movement but lacks bebop vocabulary or blues inflection. The trumpet is silent throughout, and interplay between instruments is minimal with no call-and-response or dynamic contrast. The overall feel is academic and lacks the swing, soul, and spontaneity of authentic jazz.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Replace piano triads with 7th chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7) and add extensions like 9ths and 13ths for color",
    "Add chromatic approach notes and blues inflections to the saxophone lines for bebop flavor",
    "Introduce swing eighth notes in the hihat pattern and add ghost notes on the snare for authentic Latin jazz feel",
    "Use walking bass lines with roots, 3rds, 5ths, and 7ths instead of just root notes",
    "Add ii-V-I progressions in bars 3-4 and incorporate call-and-response between the saxophone and trumpet"
  ],
  "prompt_mutation": "Mandate the use of 7th chords and extensions in the piano, demand chromatic approach notes and blues inflections in horn lines, require swing feel in the rhythm section with ghost notes and syncopation, and emphasize call-and-response between instruments. Provide examples of ii-V-I progressions and bebop phrasing patterns."
